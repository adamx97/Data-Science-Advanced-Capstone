That win makes the machine the clear winner in a best-of-five series.  The achievements of the Google DeepMind computer, AlphaGo, are considered a significant advancement in artificial intelligence.  \"To be honest, we are a bit stunned,\" said Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, after AlphaGo\\'s third win. \"We came here to challenge Lee Se-dol, as we wanted to learn from him and see what AlphaGo was capable of.',\n 'White House keeps up sanctuary cities pressure with funding threat   Washington (CNN)Attorney General Jeff Sessions outlined Monday how the Trump administration will use federal funds to crack down on \"sanctuary cities\" and states that choose not to comply with federal immigration laws, as it has threatened to do since January.  The comments came after the Trump administration has made a concerted effort to pressure the so-called \"sanctuary\" jurisdictions as part of its aggressive push to enforce immigration laws. The term refers to jurisdictions like major cities including Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia that have policies in place that limit cooperation in enforcing federal immigration laws and protect local immigrant populations.',\n 'Why Silicon Valley isn\\'t fighting to save the Internet (yet)  We thought we\\'d never have to pull this out again  one member of the singing activist group said at a tech industry rally against President Trump in San Francisco earlier this month. Then the Grannies launched into their protest song: Say to Comcast  to Verizon and to AT&T: Hands off the Internet  it must be free.\" The chant stood out at the protest  as the gathering mostly focused on Silicon Valley\\'s fight with Trump over the travel ban. It also stands out as one of the few moments since Trump\\'s inauguration when net neutrality took center stage in Silicon Valley. The net neutrality rules  approved by the Federal Communications Commission in 2015  are intended to keep the Internet open and fair. The rules prevent Internet providers from playing favorites by deliberately speeding up or slowing down traffic from specific websites and apps.',\n 'Protesters Disrupt DeVos School Visit   Protesters on Friday morning attempted to thwart a visit to a District of Columbia middle school by newly confirmed Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.  \"Stop DeVos and fund black futures,\" a group of around two dozen demonstrators chanted outside Jefferson Academy.  Demonstrators reportedly blocked the path of a vehicle they believed DeVos was in, as well as her actual car. \"I tried to block her vehicle when it came in by physically standing in front of it silently,\" an activist with Showing Up for Racial Justice explained in a video posted to Periscope.',\n \"Solar-powered 'skin' could make prosthetics more real  Many people try to stay out of the sun. But if a new type of solar-powered electronic skin makes its way onto prosthetics, wearers will definitely want those rays shining on their limbs.  Researchers are already working to create smart skin that embeds sensors that mimic the tactile feedback of human skin, making it possible for amputees to feel pressure, temperature and even dampness. But how to power the futuristic material?  A team from the University of Glasgow in the UK has come up with a version that harnesses the sun's rays. Because it produces its own energy from a natural source, the engineers say, the electronic skin would operate longer than similar materials powered by batteries or tethered to a power source that would also limit portability, clearly a key feature of any everyday prosthetic or touch-sensitive robot on the go.\",\n 'Hillary Clinton, Mocking and Taunting in Debate, Turns the Tormentor   She mansplained him. \"Let me translate that if I can,\" Hillary Clinton said dryly after Donald J. Trump talked up his tax plan.  She interrupted him. When Mr. Trump boasted of the gilded Las Vegas hotel that bears his name, Mrs. Clinton leaned into her microphone. \"Made with Chinese steel,\" she quipped with a smile.  She mocked him. After Mr. Trump said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had \"no respect\" for her, Mrs. Clinton slyly posited why Mr. Putin seemingly preferred Mr. Trump: \"He\\'d rather have a puppet as president of the United States,\" she said.',\n \"Brian Cox plays Postman Pat scientist  Professor Brian Cox may know his way around a black hole and a Higgs boson particle  but how will he fare on Postman Pat's home turf of Greendale? Find out this week when he appears on the CBeebies cartoon show as Professor Ryan Farrow  a space expert friend of Greendale's resident inventor Ted Glen. The professor's arrival is especially big news for Pat  who's always wanted to be an astronaut. Postman Pat and the Space Suit airs on Wednesday at 07:25 BST. Pictures have been released of Brian holding models of Postman Pat and his black and white cat Jess - as well as one of how he'll appear himself in animated form.\",\n 'On \\'Day Without Women,\\' Two Districts Cancel School   School districts in Virginia and North Carolina are telling students to stay home on Wednesday, on a nationwide day of protest called \"A Day Without Women,\" because so many staff members do not plan to show up for work.  In Alexandria Public Schools in Northern Virginia, more than 300 staff members have asked for the day off, prompting district officials to take the extraordinary step of canceling class. In a note on its website, the superintendent said its 18 schools would not have enough teachers on Wednesday.  \"This is not a decision that was made lightly,\" the superintendent, Alvin L. Crawley, said, adding that \"it is not based on a political stance or position.',\n ' Doping in sport: Drug use \\'fast becoming a crisis\\'  Drug use at every level of sport is \"fast becoming a crisis\" according to UK Anti-Doping - responding to a BBC poll into doping in amateur sport. It found more than a third (35%) of amateur sports people say they personally know someone who has doped  and 8% said they had taken steroids. Half believe performance enhancing substance use is \"widespread\" among those who play sport competitively. Ukad chief Nicole Sapstead described the figures as \"incredibly alarming\".

The kingdom stressed that the drastically reduced tax rate  which is retroactive to the start of 2017  would be offset by dividends and investment profits. The enormous tax relief will also add tens of billions of dollars to Aramco's coffers at a time of growing concern over how much the world's largest oil company is actually worth. While Saudi Arabia has said Aramco could be valued at $2 trillion in an expected 2018 IPO  some analysts believed that price tag was too generous. Saudi Arabia badly needs the Aramco IPO to go smoothly because it would generate a cash windfall at a time when plunging oil revenue has blown a hole in its once-vaunted budget.\",\n \" Bruno: Convicted of murdering ex-girlfriend  goalkeeper makes controversial return to soccer  After serving seven years in prison for killing his ex-girlfriend and feeding her to dogs  Brazilian goalkeeper Bruno Fernandes de Souza is controversially back in the game  signed by Boa Esporte for two years.

The \"proof,\" according to the biographer, is the \"fact\" that she hasn\\'t dated men since she was 17. That\\'s seven whole years of being only with women. But I\\'m confused. Does bisexuality come with an expiration date?  Here are some facts that Govan may not be aware of:  According to research from the Williams Institute, the leading LGBT demographic research organization in the world, there are twice as many women who identify as bisexual as there are women who identify as lesbian. That means, among women date women, the odds are two to one that a woman is out as bi.  According to lesbian professor Dr. Lisa Diamond, one of the leading scholars on women\\'s sexuality, lesbian and bisexual women more often have fluid, complex, varied sexual histories than linear, static ones. Bisexual women -- and lesbians -- may be \"50/50\" (in terms of experiences with men and women), they may have long periods of time being with just one gender, and they may even be life-long monogamists who are only ever with one person of one gender. All of that can fall under the umbrella of women who use the word \"bisexual\" to describe themselves.  And according to lesbian professor Dr. Paula Rust, the vast majority of lesbians have had sex with men, both before and after coming out as lesbians.  In fact, in the lesbian community, it\\'s so widely known that most lesbians sleep with men that there\\'s even a term for the very few who don\\'t: gold-star. A gold-star lesbian is a lesbian who has never been with a man.  So, if lesbians can -- and do -- sleep with men, and still call themselves lesbians, then why can\\'t a bisexual woman not sleep with men, and still call herself bi?  If women who identify as bisexual can have enormous variety in their sexual histories, why can\\'t Jessie J be bi?  And if there are twice as many bi women as lesbians, why can\\'t Jessie J be bi?  Research from the Williams Institute also shows that bisexuals tend to be younger than lesbians. Jessie J is 24 years old. Why can\\'t she be bi?  Govan says that Jessie J was forced to say she\\'s bi by music executives, even though she\\'s really a lesbian, because bisexuality would be more appealing to her audience. But according to Dr. Gregory Herek, the leading researcher on stigma, bisexual women are much more stigmatized than lesbians.  Research also shows that bisexual women are more likely than lesbians -- and straight women -- to be victims of domestic violence. This means that bisexual women are considered less appealing and are more attacked. (All of which is extremely disturbing, and has been the subject of much of my other writing.) My point is: this \"bisexuality will draw a bigger audience\" trope is bullshit.  One of Jessie J\\'s most famous songs is called \"Do It Like a Dude.\" Around the internet, this song is getting bandied about as further \"proof\" that she\\'s a lesbian. But first of all, why can\\'t bisexual women be masculine, too? And why must lesbians always be? Some of the most masculine women I know are bi, and some of the most feminine ones I know are lesbians.  Second of all, when you read the lyrics, you see that it\\'s actually a song about a butch woman at a bar who turns on men by being her masculine self. The lyrics say, \"Boom, boom, pour me a beer/ No pretty drinks, I\\'m a guy out here\" and later, \"Boys, come say what you wanna... Boys, gettin\\' hot under the collar.\" Why can\\'t that bi? In fact, how is it not bi?  And finally, why can\\'t Jessie J be bi just because she says she is? Why is it that when a celebrity comes out as a lesbian, I don\\'t read that she\\'s actually really secretly bi, but was pressured by her handlers to say she\\'s gay, but when someone comes out as bi, I see this kind of thing over and over again? Why is female bisexuality so unbelievable to people, and why must a woman\\'s statement about her own (bi)sexuality be discredited? How hard is it to just take a woman\\'s word for it, when she talks about her (bi)sexuality?  Why can\\'t Jessie J be bi?

When Pratt spoke to Ellen DeGeneres on her talk show Friday, he said that he and Faris, both professional actors, take parenting, specifically story time, very seriously.  \u201cWe\u2019re strangely competitive with each other when it comes to entertaining him and getting into the characters,\u201d he said, before recounting a recent bedtime-story moment: \u201cWe were reading this book, and I\u2019ll start affecting a little accent for the character, and then she\u2019s like, \u2018Oh,\u2019 and she starts gesticulating and laughing.\u201d  Pratt said that Jack seemed to pay no interest to his parents\u2019 competing dramatics. But when some version of method acting is happening in your bedroom every night, it\u2019s pretty difficult not to pick up on it.  It helps, too, when your parents trick you in to making an everyday occurrence something out of Lee Strasberg\u2019s lesson plan. When Jack was just three, Faris told Conan O\u2019Brien that she was teaching her toddler to have big, stage-worthy, emotional reactions to everyday events.  Jack seems to come by some very valuable talents naturally, though. In a 2015 interview with Ellen, Pratt told the talk-show host that he often comes to his young son for sound advice. He shared a story of how Jack picked up on tension at a family holiday gathering.  \u201cHe says amazing things, profound things,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cI was sitting down and I said, \u2018You know, Jack, there's a lot of people here, and it\u2019s very loud, and people are gonna be having a lot of fun. And there might even be some tension.\u2019 And he just said, \u2018It\u2019s family.\u2019 I almost started crying. I was like, \u2018Thank you, son; you\u2019re right.\u2019 He\u2019s like my therapist.\u201d  Jack is clearly already a perceptive kid\u2014another essential trait for a successful career in theater. Combine that with his parents\u2019 affinity for inundating him with classic Hollywood films, and his acting career will be blossoming before we know it. \",\n 'It Appears Selena Gomez Just Adopted a New Puppy With The Weeknd  Less than a week ago, Selena Gomez and The Weeknd (a.k.a. Abel Tesfaye) were spotted playing with a pack of puppies at a NYC pet store\u2014and now, it seems, Selena\\'s brought one of them home. After all, the heart wants what it wants ( wink wink ).  In photos obtained by Elle , Selena\\'s assistant Theresa Mingus was spotted on Thursday picking up the exact same Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy that Selena saw last weekend. Later, Theresa was seen delivering the pup to the \"Fetish\" singer\\'s apartment. A fan account on Twitter also posted pictures from the store before Theresa picked up the puppy, in which a sign reading \"I\\'m going HOME soon!\" posted to the dog\\'s kennel.  While many of Selena\\'s fans expressed their excitement on social media for the newest addition to her family, others were disappointed because they\\'re assuming she chose to purchase the dog from a pet store, many of which are notorious for selling puppies raised in unethical puppy mills , rather than adopting one from a shelter. \"Why buy instead of adopting this makes me so mad,\" one Twitter user wrote . In an Instagram comment screenshot by another Insta user, one person wrote , \"I also can\\'t believe you would buy a puppy from the pet stores that are breeding and putting animals in glass and have them in bad living situations. Don\\'t support stuff like that girl. Thought you knew better.\" It has not been confirmed where the pet store Selena\\'s puppy is from gets its animals, and Selena\\'s team has not confirmed or denied any information about the animal at this time.  Fans are also wondering whether the dog belongs solely to Selena\u2014who had rescued five shelter dogs as of 2010, according to People \u2014or if Abelena are co-parenting the pooch. If it\\'s the latter, they won\\'t be alone: Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner, who have been dating since December, adopted a husky puppy together just last weekend and have already set up an Instagram account for Porky Basquiat.

The Hands to Myself singer was spotted with the Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales actor at his 39th birthday party on Wednesday, as seen in a photo on Hollywood Life shared by Bloom\\'s manager Aleen Keshishian.  \"They have the same manager and are friends through her,\" a source tells PEOPLE.  Gomez, in a little black dress, also shared a polaroid from the bash with a sweet caption for Bloom. \"Happy bday Orly \u2013 celebrate kindness and who you are,\" the 23-year-old wrote.  Most recently, she and Bloom both attended the InStyle/Warner Bros. Golden Globes afterparty on Sunday.  Back in April 2014, the pair were romantically linked after they were spotted at a comedy show together. That same year in July, Bloom and Gomez\\'s ex Justin Bieber allegedly got into an altercation over the father of one\\'s ex-wife Miranda Kerr.  Gomez did previously reveal that she would \"love to date older guys\" but insisted she still looks too young.  At the Golden Globes, Bloom was spotted getting close to Katy Perry while Gomez shut down rumors she\\'s dating Charlie Puth.

Just know it\\'s coming and it\\'s not scary.\"  But even his sound advice couldn\\'t stop the pair from shrieking and recoiling in fear as masked monsters popped out of the darkness. At one point, Andy even sacrificed chivalry for safety, shoving Jacqueline in front of him, causing her to exclaim, \"You go first!

',\n 'Billy Bush officially sacked from NBC Today show after leaked lewd Donald Trump tape scandal  Bush was suspended at the morning show two days after contents of the 2005 tape were reported on October 7.  NBC and Bush\\'s representatives had been negotiating terms of his exit before Monday\\'s announcement.  On the tape, Bush is heard laughing as Trump talks about fame enabling him to grope and try to have sex with women not his wife. Bush later said he was \"embarrassed and ashamed.\" Trump has since denied groping women.  Bush, who had been at Today for two months, is the nephew of Republican former President George H.W. Bush.  NBC made the announcement of his firing in a note from Today show top executive Noah Oppenheim to his staff. Oppenheim called Bush, who spent 15 years at Access Hollywood, \"a valued colleague and longtime member of the broader NBC family. We wish him success as he goes forward.\"  Bush, a 44-year-old father of three, said that he was \"deeply grateful for the conversations I\\'ve had with my daughters, and for all of the support from family, friends and colleagues. I look forward to what lies ahead.\"  The settlement with NBC did not include a non-compete clause, meaning Bush \"is a free agent,\" said his lawyer, Marshall Grossman. Financial terms of the deal were kept confidential.  TMZ reports that Bush had just joined NBC\\'s flagship show in August, signing a three-year deal for $3.5 million per year. He was tipped to receive millions in his settlement with NBC.  In the 2005 tape, which was first revealed by The Washington Post, Trump discusses unsuccessfully seeking an affair with another Access Hollywood employee, Nancy O\\'Dell. Trump said that when he was attracted to beautiful women \"I just start kissing them. It\\'s like a magnet.\" He said that when you\\'re a star, women let you. \"Grab them by the p----. You can do anything,\" Trump added.  The two men discussed an actor who was waiting from at the end of the bus ride. When they got off, Bush urged the woman to hug Trump and added, \"how about a little hug for the Bushy?\" Trump said in the second presidential debate that he never did any of the actions heard on the tape, which he described as locker room talk. But a number of women have since come forward and said that Trump had surprised them in the past by groping or unexpectedly kissing them on the lips.  In an interview with CNN on Monday, Trump\\'s wife, Melania, said that her husband was \"egged on\" by Bush in the conversation. \"I wonder if they even knew the mic was on,\" Melania Trump said, referring to her husband and Bush. She said they were involved in \"boy talk, and he was led on - like egged on - from the host to say dirty and bad stuff.\" Asked to comment, Grossman said, \"I thought that Donald Trump would claim that he was not on the bus.\" ',\n \" Justin Bieber carries a bible while donning preppy tennis clothes  He's not exactly known for being the kind of guy you'd take home to mom and dad.  But Justin Bieber seemed like the boy-next-door on Friday, donning a preppy look while out in LA.  The 23-year-old singer looked ready to meet the family, wearing head-to-toe white while also carrying what looked like a Bible in his hand.  The Cold Water singer looked to be in good spirits, joined by a friend during his afternoon outing.  Walking through the parking lot in white Yeezys, the smiley singer carried a copy of a what looked like a Bible as well as a slim laptop.  As he chatted with his friend,\\xa0Justin's many tattoos were on display in the Adidas ensemble.  Not visible, however, was his newest ink - a large lion head on his left pec.  The 'lion-hearted' artist took to Instagram last week to reflect on how much he's grown since his last arrest in 2014 and to thank God for blessing the Love Yourself singer.  Posting a split shot of his current self and his January 2014 mug shot, Justin looked back at the progress he's made over the past few years, having remained arrest-free since August of 2014.  'I LOVE THIS because it reminds me IM NOT EXACTLY WHERE I WANT TO BE BUT THANK GOD IM NOT WHERE I USED TO BE!!' he wrote, adding, 'THE BEST IS YET TO COME DO YOU BELIEVE IT?'  The Baby singer was taken into custody on January 23, 2014 after officials said they saw the singer drag racing in a yellow Lamborghini with a friend.  He later was charged with resisting arrest and DUI after failing a field sobriety test and then cursing out authorities attempting to take him into custody, according to police.  Bieber eventually worked out a plea deal with prosecutors in the case, as he pleaded guilty to careless driving and resisting arrest, paying a $500 fine, completing anger management and drunken driving programs; and making a donation of $50,000 to the local charity Our Kids prior to the agreement. \",\n \"Beyonc\u00e9 Is Pregnant With Twins, Let The Conspiracy Theories Commence  Last night, the world officially went into meltdown after Beyonc\u00e9 announced she and Jay Z were expecting twins.  With the help of contemporary artist Awol Erizku, Queen Bee shared her exciting news on social media, showing the veiled mother-to-be caressing her stomach, surrounded by reams of flowers, in what has now become the most liked Instagram picture of all time.  Hours later, the rumour mill went into overdrive, with several conspiracy theories popping up.  Some of them questioning the timing of her announcement, others interpreting the Instagram post like its a James Joyce epic poem. Soon, there will be more illuminati claims and eventually someone is bound to figure that she's not really pregnant at all and that it was all a ruse.  Let's have a look at the ideas that have been floated so far.  Firstly, many astute BeyHive fans were quick to point out the Lemonade star might have given us a hint about her pregnancy via Instagram six weeks ago.  In a post to Instagram before Christmas, the 'Halo' singer shared a slideshow of photos of herself in a suede navy dress and silver antlers, which show her in back-to-back photos appearing to hold her stomach.  In the clip, the star can be seen holding up a peace sign \u2013 or a number two \u2013 before making a heart shape with her hands.  While it's plausible to believe the singer was simply sharing a message of peace and love to her fans during the festive seasons, rumours of the hidden baby announcement have now taken Twitter by storm.  Meanwhile, other Bey fans are suspicious of the pregnancy news' timing.  Next week, Beyonce will attend the 59th Annual Grammy Awards \u2013 an occasion particularly close to the singer's heart given the fact she's amassed 53 nominations and 20 wins over the years.  Following the unprecedented success of her sixth studio album Lemonade, which has been nominated for staggering nine Grammy awards this year, some fans are thinking her well-timed pregnancy announcement to be a clever PR stunt to prevent the news detracting from her award-winning album and Grammy performance.  After all, when Beyonce opened her jacket to confirm her pregnancy following her rendition of Love On Top at the VMAs in 2011, it was this gesture \u2013 rather than the song \u2013 that naturally caught the world's attention.  It is, of course, reasonable to assume that one of the most famous women in the world might have put some thought into the perfect way to time her pregnancy announcement to the world.  But some of the theories that developed during her first pregnancy reached hilarious levels of fantasy.  Let's not forget that when Ms. Knowles-Carter announced her first pregnancy with the now-five-year-old Blue Ivy Carter, many people believed it to be fake, with talk of a shifting stomach during an appearance on an Australian television show and suspicion as to the lack of pregnancy photos before the birth.  This is the same woman who openly spoke out about the heartache of suffering a miscarriage before falling pregnancy with her first child, admitting the sound of her baby's heartbeat was 'the most beautiful music I ever heard in my life', during her HBO documentary Life Is But a Dream.  While it's unknown how far along the singer is in her second pregnancy, it's fairly traditional for a woman to keep the news hush hush until she's out of the first trimester.  Perhaps it is also worth considering that Beyonce and Jay Z might have been cautious in sharing the news of their family growing at a time when civil, reproductive and women's rights are currently under threat by the Trump administration in the US.  In all fairness to Beyonc\u00e9 though, she's allowed to announce her news whenever she damn pleases really.  Just look at Adele and Eva Mendes, who kept their pregnancies quiet until the actual births, making a statement about the fact that, even though celebrities are in the public eye, they and their families are not public property.  Some conspiracy theories can be quite fun, admittedly, mostly when they are completely inconceivable or bizarre, but for now, let's focus on the fact Queen Bee is about to welcome two of the coolest kids to the planet.\",\n 'Caitlyn Jenner: false rumors around her, her strained family ties and her candid memoir! Read on it here! \u2013  RadarOnline published a story about Caitlyn claiming that the transgender reality TV star and former decathlete is going online to explore her sexuality and has been enjoying a number of secret \u2018cyber hookups\u2019. The definition of \u2018hookups\u2019 has not been clarified in the story. But the report states that Caitlyn Jenner has been into online romances without any offline interactions with the clients. The tabloid has quoted an insider as saying:  The source has asserted that:  It goes on to say that the TV personality goes online anonymously with disguises and using a speech decoder to alter her voice.  However, Gossip Cop has found out that this story is totally baseless. It has been seen that the tabloid has recycled this story over the years many times. But it has never come out to be true. Caitlyn\u2019s rep has confirmed that all this is false.  Caitlyn Jenner had released her 320 paged memoir in end April 2017. But she had not realized the aftermath of it. The picture is getting uglier with time and her relations with her family are only going from bad to worse. On 6th June 2017, Caitlyn Jenner was seen stepping out alone in Malibu. The reality TV personality has suffered a fall out with her daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner. As she stepped out, she looked downcast in a white lace-up sweater and blue jeans. She wore a pair of slip on sandals with a small heel. Since her strained relations with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and her daughters, Bruce-turned-Caitlyn has been seen alone in Malibu.

But according to some people, they are - and if true, it could be\\xa0huge news in the music business.  Though there\\'s little evidence to support the theory that Drake and Taylor are an item, people online have been conjecturing wildly. Here\\'s what we\\xa0know.  At the stroke of midnight, on the evening of October 23, Drake\\xa0turned 30 years old. He hosted a big birthday party and, as celebrities do, had\\xa0a bunch of other celebrities and hanger-ons there.  \"Taylor arrived with some friends and looked to be having fun,\" an anonymous source told E!. \"After dinner there was lots of dancing. At one point Drake and Taylor were seen near the DJ together talking, his arm over her shoulder for a minute like a real friend moment. It looked like they were talking about something deep.\"  At some point during the evening, \"everyone sang happy birthday to Drake,\" according to E!. Swift was presumably among the singers.  Drake also introduced Swift to his mom,\\xa0according to TMZ. Swift and Drake\\xa0posed for a few photos, and that\\'s the extent of their known contact that night.  So,\\xa0are they dating?

E! News confirmed the report:  For those surprised by the seemingly unlikely duo, our source reveals \"the music they have been working on is different,\" albeit \"very catchy.\" The insider adds, \"They\\'ve both been having a great time in the studio.\"  That means they\\'re spending a lot of time together. Possibly alone. Possibly not. So they could be working on music together, and they could be hooking up. Who\\'s to say?  Drake has an impish, winking relationship with his fans. On \"Saturday Night Live,\" he once sang about how he\\'s more than just\\xa0a meme. So later in November, he posted a\\xa0picture of himself and Swift together with the caption \"Is that velvet? \"  A photo posted by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Nov 4, 2016 at 1:34am PDT\\xa0on  Once again, a general freak out occurred. The coy flower emoji seemed especially designed to make people wonder what on earth was happening.  The hip-hop artist released an ad where - in his self-aware persona - he sings along to Swift\\'s \"Bad Blood.\"  It\\'s a reference to a commercial Swift made a few months earlier, where she ran on a treadmill, and fell off it, while singing along to Drake and Future\\'s \"Jumpman.\"  And when Drake posted his ad on Instagram, he snuck in the hashtag \"#Draylor.\" Maybe it\\'s a hashtag for the ad, maybe it\\'s a hashtag for the two as a couple. Clearly, Swift and Drake\\xa0are friendly enough to make referential meta-jokes about one another.  The Swift-Drake relationship is less about actual evidence that they\\'re dating and more about wish fulfillment and fun speculation. Fans don\\'t believe the couple are dating as much as they want to will their relationship into existence.  But why does it hold so much appeal?  For her part, Swift recently ended a summer fling\\xa0with Tom Hiddleston.\\xa0That relationship was a strange fit. Swift is one of the biggest celebrities in the world. Hiddleston - though he is a fine actor, conventionally attractive, and still the best villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - is simply not on her level.  Apart from star power, Hiddleston, 35, always seemed so much older than\\xa0Swift, 26. For these reasons and more, Hiddleswift always made for a\\xa0slightly bizarre coupling to outsiders.  Meanwhile, Drake has been in\\xa0an on-again-off-again relationship\\xa0with Rihanna for years. It arguably culminated in August when Drake professed his love for her on stage in the VMAs. But right now, they\\'re off again.  A Swift-Drake relationship would\\xa0distract the public from any image-altering breakups\\xa0and reestablish both of them as the desirable, \u00fcber talented A-listers they are.  Of course, this\\xa0narrative could\\xa0just be publicity for their new song together. Even if Swift and Drake aren\\'t in love, they\\'re a match made in PR heaven.

ORIGINAL STORY: Halle Berry\u2019s rep has denied that the Oscar winner is pregnant with her third child.  \u201cIt is absolutely not true. She is not pregnant,\u201d the actress\u2019 rep tells Us Weekly of rumors Berry is expecting again.  Berry, 50, first sparked pregnancy rumors when she attended the Butterfly Ball in L.A. on Sunday, June 4. The actress, in a form-fitting silver sequined dress and a jacket by Yeon, placed her hands on her stomach and appeared to be cradling a baby bump.  The Extant actress is already mom of daughter Nahla, 8, with ex Gabriel Aubry, and has 3-year-old son Maceo with ex-husband Olivier Martinez.  Berry filed for divorce from Martinez, 51, after two years of marriage in October 2015. They reportedly finalized their divorce in December 2016.  \u201cThings were extremely bitter with them as the marriage went on and in the end,\u201d a source told Us Weekly at the time. \u201cFinally they both tried to file against each other. It was always like that, very heated and a lot of competition and battling between them.

It\u2019s the most glorious thing you\u2019ll ever do, but the aftermath is not so glorious!\u201d she said, shortly after giving birth to Nahla. \u201cI used to work a lot because I had nothing better to do. What I\u2019ve learned, especially by having a baby, is that you can\u2019t bring that stuff home anymore.\u201d  ',\n \"Jessica Simpson Flashes Her Butt for Eric Johnson's Birthday: Pic  Less is more!

Last month Rolling Stone conducted its first full-scale interview with Paul McCartney, in six sessions starting in a London recording studio and ending on a New York street. The New York sessions took place the day after McCartney had entered the US for the first time in two years, visa problems stemming from two marijuana violations now finally resolved.  McCartney was cautious in his responses during the first two sessions. He and Linda remembered being on vacation in Scotland when they were first shown John Lennon\\'s lengthy interview (Rolling Stone Number 74 and Number 75, January 21st and February 4th, 1971), and having been deeply hurt by it. At first he seemed to want to avoid the kind of controversy Lennon\\'s interview had generated but in later conversations he became freer with his answers.  Because the various sessions were necessarily disconnected, our text does not follow in all cases the actual sequence of questions. For example, McCartney\\'s discussion of his legal difficulties is compiled from three separate conversations. One of those discussions was prompted by an incident on a New York street. We were walking down 54th Street towards the New York office of Eastman and Eastman, attorneys \u2013 Lee and John Eastman, father and brother of Linda McCartney (whose photographs illustrate this interview).  A man in a gray suit with a colorful umbrella approached McCartney and asked, \"Mr. McCartney? This is for you.\" It was an American copy of a process from Allen Klein that had been served on Paul two weeks before in London. An outraged PR man howled; McCartney smiled and told the man, \"Thank you very much.\" He was being sarcastic.  The villain of the scenario, so far as he was concerned, was not the man in the gray suit, but Klein himself, whom McCartney calls a \"punk.\" McCartney claims he sued his fellow ex-Beatles in High Court because it was the only way to sue Klein. When we queried the head of ABKCO Industries about the suit, he seemed to relish the new confrontation. \"He now has the opportunity to say anything he wants in court,\" Klein told us. \"He has his opportunity to fight me face to face. I am welcoming it. Now he\\'s in the same ring with me. Isn\\'t that what he wanted?\"  John Eastman made this statement concerning the Beatles/Apple/Klein suits and Paul\\'s involvement in them:  \"John Lennon, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono, Apple and others started an action in England against ABKCO and Klein. This complaint alleges ABKCO and Klein took excessive commissions, practiced fraud, suggested conduct which would have been a fraud on the tax authorities in the US and UK, mismanaged Bangla Desh and otherwise mismanaged the affairs of the complainant. This action is now pending against ABKCO and Klein.  \"ABKCO then sued Lennon, Harrison, Starr, Yoko Ono, Apple and other related companies in the US. It claims damages against them of $63,461,372.87 plus future earnings.  \"ABKCO also joined Paul, claiming conspiracy. Its only claim against Paul is that Paul conspired with Yoko Ono, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr as well as Bag Production and other corporations wantonly, maliciously, fraudulently, wrongfully and intentionally without justification in law or fact to damage or injure plaintiff (ABKCO).\\' Damages are sought for this alleged conspiracy of $34 million plus interest.\"  Our interviews were delayed some months, first by a Wings tour and later by a series of recording sessions in Nigeria. Even after that wait, the McCartneys seemed surprised at how much we wanted to know. In the end they were interviewed in a London recording studio, Paul\\'s Soho office, Lee Eastman\\'s offices and apartment in New York (where baby Stella McCartney wore the interviewer\\'s watch on her foot) and the studio of cover photographer Francesco Scavullo. As the interview begins, Paul is telling how he wrote one of the songs he recorded in Nigeria.  \u2013 P.G.  We were in Jamaica on holiday and we were staying in a little house outside Montego Bay, and we read in the local newspaper, The Daily Gleaner, that Dustin Hoffman and Steve McQueen were in town filming Papillon. They were just along the coast from us. We were saying it would be great to meet him, have dinner with him, so Linda rang up. She\\'s good at that, I\\'m always a bit embarrassed.  We got friendly and were chatting away. We\\'d been talking about songwriting, and Dustin was saying he thought it was an incredible gift to be able to write a song about something. People think that, but I always maintain it\\'s the same as any gift. It probably is more magical because it\\'s music, and I think it is more magical. But take his acting talent. It\\'s great. I was saying, \"It\\'s the same as you and acting, when the man says \\'Action!\\' you just pull it out of the bag, don\\'t you? You don\\'t know where it comes from, you just do it! How do you get all of your characterizations? It\\'s just in you.  So he says, \"You mean you can just do it, like that?\" He was lovely, Dustin. [Does Dustin Hoffman impersonation.] \"You can just do it?\" We went back a couple of days later and he said, \"I\\'ve been thinking about this, I\\'ve seen a little thing in Time magazine about Picasso, and it struck me as being very poetic. I think this would be really great set to music.\" It was one of those Passed On bits, you know, Transition or whatever they call it. ... [Sees unusually dressed studio assistant.] ... Transvestite. ... So he says there\\'s a little story here. In the article he supposedly said, \"Drink to me, drink to my health, you know I can\\'t drink any more.\" He went to paint a bit, and then he went to bed at three in the morning. He didn\\'t wake up the next morning and they found him, dead.  I happened to have my guitar with me, I\\'d brought it around, and I said, yeah, sure. I strummed a couple of chords I knew I couldn\\'t go wrong on and started singing \"Drink to me, drink to my health,\" and he leaps out of his chair and says, \"Annie! Annie!\" That\\'s his wife. He says, \"Annie! Annie! The most incredible thing! He\\'s doing it! He\\'s writing it! It\\'s coming out!\" He\\'s leaping up and down, just like in the films, you know. And I\\'m knocked out because he\\'s so appreciative. I was writing the tune there and he was well-chuffed.  Then we went to Nigeria and we were working in Ginger\\'s studio \u2013 Ginger Baker/ARC Studio in Lagos, nice studio down there. We thought we\\'d do this Picasso number, and we started off doing it straight. Then we thought, Picasso was kind of far out in his pictures, he\\'d done all these different kinds of things, fragmented, Cubism and the whole bit. I thought it would be nice to get a track a bit like that, put it through different moods, cut it up, edit it, mess around with it \u2013 like he used to do with his pictures. You see the old films of him painting, he paints it once and if he doesn\\'t like it he paints it again, right on top of it, and by about 25 times he\\'s got his picture. So we tried to use this kind of idea, I don\\'t know much about it to tell you the truth, but what we did know we tried to get in the song, sort of a Cubist thing.   Then there was the trouble in Nigeria with Fela Ransome Kuti [Ex-Ginger Baker\\'s Air Force]. You heard about that? All it was was we were recording in Lagos. Lately we\\'ve gone to two different places to record, just for the fun of it. We\\'ve been to Lagos and to Paris and in both of the places they say, \"Why did you come here? You\\'ve got much better studios in England or America, you must be daft!\" And we say, \"Well, it\\'s just for the fun, it\\'s just to come somewhere different for a different type of turn-on, that\\'s all.\" They never really seem to be able to understand it. I think old Fela, when he found us in Lagos, thought, \"Hello, why have they come to Lagos?\" And the only reason he could think of was that we must be stealing black music, black African music, the Lagos sound, we\\'d come down there to pick it up. So I said, \"Do us a favor, we do OK as it is, we\\'re not pinching your music.\"  They felt that they have their own little ethnic thing going and these big foreigners are taking all their bit and beating them back to the West with it. Because they have a lot of difficulty getting their sound heard in the West. There\\'s not an awful lot of demand, except for things like, what was it, \"Soul Makossa.\" Except for that kind of thing they don\\'t really get heard.  And they are brilliant, it\\'s incredible music down there. I think it will come to the fore. And I thought my visit would, if anything, help them, because it would draw attention to Lagos and people would say, \"Oh, by the way, what\\'s the music down there like?\" and I\\'d say it was unbelievable. It is unbelievable. When I heard Fela Ransome Kuti the first time, it made me cry, it was that good.  You\\'ve just had some musicians leave, haven\\'t you? Our drummer [Denny Seiwell] didn\\'t want to come to Africa. I don\\'t know quite why. He was a bit nervous about coming to Africa. We\\'re all going to Africa to record and if the drummer won\\'t come, what do you do? You don\\'t say, \"Well, we\\'ll see you when we get back, thanks a lot we understand.\" You say, \"Well, er, ummm,\" and he leaves.  I think [guitarist] Henry McCulloch came to a head one day when I was asking him to play something he didn\\'t really fancy playing. We all got a bit choked about it, and he rang up later and said he was leaving. I said, \"Well, OK.\" That\\'s how that happened. You know, with the kind of music we play, a guitarist has got to be a bit adaptable. It was just one of those things. I don\\'t think there was anything wrong with them as musicians, they were both good musicians, but they just didn\\'t fit in.  In the film \\'A Hard Day\\'s Night,\\' there were the stereotypes \u2013 if you remember John the thinker, Ringo the loner, and Paul the happy-go-lucky. Did you object to that? No, I didn\\'t mind it. No, no; I still don\\'t. I was in a film. I don\\'t care what they picture me as. So far as I\\'m concerned I\\'m just doing a job in a film. If the film calls for me to be a cheerful chap, well, great; I\\'ll be a cheerful chap.  It does seem to have fallen in my role to be kind of a bit more that than others. I was always known in the Beatle thing as being the one who would kind of sit the press down and say, \"Hello, how are you? Do you want a drink?\" and make them comfortable. I guess that\\'s me. My family loop was like that. So I kind of used to do that, plus a little more polished than I might normally have done, but you\\'re aware you\\'re talking to the press. ... You want a good article, don\\'t you, so you don\\'t want to go sluggin\\' the guys off.  But I\\'m not ashamed of anything I\\'ve been, you know. I kind of like the idea of doing something and if it turns out in a few years to look a bit sloppy I\\'d say, \"Oh well, sloppy. So what?\" I think most people dig it. You get people livin\\' out in Queens or say Red Creek, Minnesota, and they\\'re all wiped out themselves ... you know, ordinary people. Once you get into the kind of critical bit, people analyzing you and then you start to look at yourself and start to analyze yourself, and you think, oh Christ, you got me, and things start to rebound on ya, why didn\\'t I put on a kind of smart image ... you know, why wasn\\'t I kind of tougher? I\\'m not really tough. I\\'m not really lovable, either, but I don\\'t mind falling in the middle. My dad\\'s advice: moderation, son. Every father in the world tells you moderation. [Linda laughs hysterically in the background.]  British parents aren\\'t different ... No, they\\'re exactly the same. My dad could be the perfect American stereotype father. He\\'s a good lad, though; I like him, you know.  I tell you what. I think that a lot of people worried about that kind of stuff didn\\'t often have very good family scenes, and something happened in their family to make them bitter. OK, in the normal day-to-day life a lot of polished talk goes on ... you don\\'t love everyone you meet, but you try and get on with people, you know, you don\\'t try and put \\'em up-tight; most people don\\'t anyway.  So to me that\\'s always been the way. I mean, there\\'s nothin\\' wrong with that; why should I go around slugging people? I really didn\\'t like all that John did. But I\\'m sure that he doesn\\'t now.  Have you talked to him about that? No, but I know John and I know that most of it was just something to tell the newspapers. He was in that mood then and he wanted all that to be said. I think, now, whilst he probably doesn\\'t regret it, he didn\\'t mean every single syllable of it. I mean, he came out with all stuff like I\\'m like Engelbert Humperdinck. I know he doesn\\'t really think that. In the press, they really wanted me to come out and slam John back and I used to get pissed at the guys coming up to me and saying, \"This is the latest thing John said and what\\'s your answer.\" And I\\'d say, \"Well, don\\'t really have much of an answer. He\\'s got a right to say ...\" \u2013 you know, really limp things, I\\'d answer. But I believe keep cool and that sort of thing and it passes over. I don\\'t believe if someone kind of punches you over you have to go kind of thumping him back to prove you\\'re a man and that kind of thing. I think, actually, you do win that way in the end, you know.  What was your reaction when you read that stuff at the time? Oh, I hated it. You can imagine, I sat down and pored over every little paragraph, every little sentence. \"Does he really think that of me?\" I thought. And at the time, I thought, \"It\\'s me. I am. That\\'s just what I\\'m like. He\\'s captured me so well; I\\'m a turd, you know.\" I sat down and really thought, I\\'m just nothin\\'. But then, well, kind of people who dug me like Linda said, \"Now you know that\\'s not true, you\\'re joking. He\\'s got a grudge, man; the guy\\'s trying to polish you off.\" Gradually I started to think, great, that\\'s not true. I\\'m not really like Engelbert; I don\\'t just write ballads. And that kept me kind of hanging on; but at the time, I tell you, it hurt me. Whew. Deep.  Could you write a song or songs with John again? I could. It\\'s totally fresh ground, right now, \\'cause I just got my visa, too. About two or three days ago; and until then, I couldn\\'t physically write a song with John; he was in America. He couldn\\'t get out. I couldn\\'t get in. But now that\\'s changed so whole new possibilities are opening up. Anything could happen. I like to write with John. I like to write with anyone who\\'s good.  Right now you yourself are working on The Mouse Gang. No, it\\'s not the Mouse Gang, it\\'s a show that will be called the Bruce McMouse Show.  I was thinking of The Zoo Gang. The Zoo Gang, that\\'s right, that\\'s just a theme tune for a television show I was asked to do. Bruce McMouse is another thing. We filmed the last couple of dates at the end of Wings\\' first European tour. Bruce lives under the stage, you see. [Bruce and his family are animated and their exploits are spliced in between Wings\\' footage for a television film.]  Are you constantly deluged with this type of offer? Not deluged. I get quite a few, you know. I just try and choose the ones I like the sound of. It\\'s not anything I plan out. I remember a thing in Rolling Stone \u2013 there\\'s a little bit of chat, I read the papers, you know \u2013 that said \"McCartney\\'s going to do Live and Let Die, so it\\'s come to that, has it?\" I thought, you silly sods. Because we were talking to another paper and when I said I was going to do Live and Let Die, the 007 thing, the reporter said, \"Hey, man, that\\'s real hip.\" So it just depends which way you look at it.  \"Give Ireland Back to the Irish\" was the first of your singles in eight years that didn\\'t sell in America and Britain. Before I did that, I always used to think, God, John\\'s crackers, doing all these political songs. I understand he really feels deeply, you know. So do I. I hate all that Nixon bit, all that Ireland bit, and oppression anywhere. I think our mob do, our generation do hate that and wish it could be changed, but up until the actual time when the paratroopers went in and killed a few people, a bit like Kent State, the moment when it is actually there on the doorstep, I always used to think it\\'s still cool to not say anything about it, because it\\'s not going to sell anyway and no one\\'s gonna be interested.  So I tried it, it was Number One in Ireland and, funnily enough, it was Number One in Spain, of all places. I don\\'t think Franco could have understood.  [At this point Paul receives word that a playback of Bruce McMouse is beginning in the control room. He excuses himself and we chat with Linda while Denny Laine plays a medley of Tim Hardin songs on the studio piano.]  Did you feel scared when McCartney was released, since that was your debut and the first song was pegged at you? No. I didn\\'t take it as seriously as I probably should have. I think it was good copy at the time to slag everything. Everybody was getting slagged, the Beatles were getting slagged. I personally didn\\'t realize you had to explain yourself a lot once you get into the public eye. I just carried on with my normal life, like I had in New York, and I just got all this slagging. It never really brought me down much, though.  Do you think any Mrs. McCartney in that situation would have been slagged? I think in what was going down then, yes. There was so much trouble for everybody, not done by one particular person, that everybody was getting blamed. I still can\\'t look at it from the angle that I\\'m Mrs. McCartney. You know what I mean? I still see me as the person I\\'ve always been, either you like me or you don\\'t. Paul likes me. [Laughter.]  And stood up for you during the slagging. He was living with me, he knows I\\'m a good chick, he knows I don\\'t have any bad motives. I\\'m not a grabber, I\\'m not any of that. He wouldn\\'t have married me if I had been. So he stuck by me.  I just read totally bizarre stuff about myself. People would do an article on me and then an article on Yoko from childhood on up. I couldn\\'t believe it. It was total fantasy. I mean, none of that happened, folks.  Unlike John, who went to a solo career, Paul went to a group. John didn\\'t really go to a solo career, there was the Plastic Ono Band and that. But Paul is very much a teamwork person. He doesn\\'t like working just on his own. He still gets nervous. He likes working with people, bouncing off people and having them bounce off him. He likes helping people.   Have you ever entertained the thought of doing a record by yourself? Not Linda McCartney\\'s Great Single, no. I fool around with the songs I write, but I don\\'t take it as a serious career.  You do have the novelty single coming up? Yes. I did a song, \"Seaside Woman,\" right after we\\'d been to Jamaica, about three or four years ago, I guess. Very reggae-inspired. That\\'s when ATV was suing us saying I was incapable of writing, so Paul said, \"Get out and write a song.\" And then about a week ago we went in to do a B side for it of something I\\'d written in Africa, some chords I wrote in Africa, and we just talk over it. It\\'s very sort of Fifties R&B, the Doves, the Penguins. I love that, that was my era. I\\'m New York, you know, Alan Freed and the whole bit.  We\\'re going to put the single out under the name Suzi and the Red Stripes. When we were in Jamaica, there had been a fantastic reggae version of \"Suzi Q,\" so they used to call me Suzi. And the beer in Jamaica is called Red Stripe, so that makes it Suzi and the Red Stripes. It\\'ll be out someday, but I\\'ve been saying \"Seaside Woman\" will be released since 1971 and we still haven\\'t bothered. It\\'s a bit like my photography book. Someday there will be a book.  Was it strictly through you that your father became associated with Paul as his lawyer? It\\'s through me, actually. I remember saying to my father, when I\\'d met Paul a few times but wasn\\'t living with him, after Brian died, that he had helped a lot of people out of messes, could he help? He said well, I don\\'t know. I said it would be great because I know you could help them out. So then I introduced Paul to my dad, and they got along instantly. If he hadn\\'t met my father, Klein would have just hawked right in there.  [At this point we retire to the control room. Linda goes over the Walt Disney Christmas show script, then talks on the phone to someone at EMI. \"I think the only bit we\\'d like to add is a little bit from 101 Dalmatians ...\"  [Paul talks to the engineer of Dark Side of the Moon. They marvel at its sales record, and the engineer notes that Pink Floyd are going to give him a Christmas present. \"Ask for a percentage,\" McCartney recommends. \"It\\'s the best present they could give you. What that album has done so far is amazing. In France, it\\'s outsold Abbey Road ...\"]  How did you meet Linda? Linda and I met in a club in London called the Bag of Nails, which was right about the time that the club scene was going strong in London. She was down there with some friends. I think she was down there with Chas Chandler and some other people, and I was down there with some friends, including a guy who used to work at the office. I was in my little booth and she was in her little booth and we were giving each other the eye you know. Georgie Fame was playing that night and we were both right into Georgie Fame.  When did you first realize you wanted to marry her? About a year later. We both thought it a bit crazy at the time, and we also thought it would be a gas. Linda was a bit dubious, because she had been married before and wasn\\'t too set on settling. In a way, she thought it tends to blow things, marrying ruins it. But we both fancied each other enough to do it. And now we\\'re glad we did it, you know. It\\'s great. I love it.  Some of the critical notices on her debut performances seemed to ask where she had come from. Yeah. Well, the answer is, nowhere, really.  Mick Jagger had that quote. He wouldn\\'t let... ... his old lady in the band, yeah. That was all very understandable at the time because she did kind of appear out of nowhere. To most people, she was just some chick. I just figure she was the main help for me on the albums around that time. She was there every day, helping on harmonies and all of that stuff.  It\\'s like you write millions of love songs and finally when you\\'re in love you\\'d kind of like to write one for the person you\\'re in love with. So I think all this business about getting Linda in the billing was just a way of saying, \"Listen, I don\\'t care what you think, this is what I think. I\\'m putting her right up there with me.\"  Later we thought it might have been cooler not to introduce her so bluntly. Perhaps a little more show business: \"Ladies and gentlemen, I\\'d like to introduce you to my better half. Isn\\'t she sweet and coy?\"  It turns out it didn\\'t matter, it didn\\'t matter one bit. At the time it was a little rough, maybe. At the time it was rough for her. None of us realized what ... it was like someone marrying Mick, you don\\'t realize ... you know there\\'s going to be a lot of fans who are going to hate it, but you still end up thinking, well, it\\'s my life. I know of a lot of rock & roll stars or just even show business people who will regulate their life to their image. It can mess you up a lot. I know a lot of guys from the old days who wouldn\\'t get married, even if they wanted to. Wouldn\\'t get married because it might affect their careers. The old management thing \u2013 \"You can\\'t get married, all your fans are going to desert you.\" So the guy doesn\\'t get married.  But the thing is, in a couple of years, his career is over anyway. And he didn\\'t get married, and he went and blew it. So I didn\\'t. \"Well, I\\'m not going to let that kind of thing interfere with me.\" Although I didn\\'t wish to blow my career, I thought it was more important to get on with living. We went ahead and just did what we felt like doing. Some of it came out possibly a bit offensive to some people, but it turns out that it didn\\'t matter in the first place. You just keep going.  Did your friends in music stick by you at that time or did you find it a little tough? Or did you have that many friends at the time? I remember Ringo saying at the time \"How many friends have I got?\" and he couldn\\'t count them on one hand. And that\\'s what it boils down to, really. You can have millions of friends, but when someone asks you how many friends you\\'ve got, it depends on how honestly you\\'re going to answer. Because I don\\'t think I have that many. No one went against me or anything, I think I isolated myself a bit. It\\'s just one of those things. We had just met for the first time. We\\'re very romantic, the both of us, and we didn\\'t really want to hang out with anyone else.  Do you often go back to Liverpool? We visit to keep in touch with the Liverpool scene. My family roots are up there, our kids love, it, and my brother still lives there. In fact, we\\'re going to make an album with him in January.  Will it come out as a Mike McGear album? That\\'s right. It\\'s a singing thing, he\\'s quit comedy for the moment. We\\'re going to do it at Strawberry Studios in Stockport. We\\'ll play it by ear, it\\'s Mike\\'s album.  Is it difficult for the kids, being your daughters? I don\\'t think so, I don\\'t think they\\'re going to be crazed-out kids. But it is funny sometimes. I remember I was sitting in a field and Heather was leading Mary and a little baby on a pony, and Mary just said to me, \"You\\'re Paul McCartney, aren\\'t you?\" When she\\'s talking to me normally, she\\'ll just call me Daddy. When there\\'s company around, she knows I\\'m Paul McCartney, in inverted commas.  It\\'s nice that we have all girls. If we had a son it might be harder on him, like Frank Sinatra, Jr. Everyone assumes he\\'ll turn out to be his dad. At the moment, there\\'s not much to worry about with the kids.  At your Oxford press conference you mentioned your four-year-old daughter liked the Osmonds. Linda says your ten-year-old daughter is a bit off them now ... Yes, she is a bit...  ...but I understand you met the Osmonds in Paris, which is a very unusual situation. It must have been as much of a thrill for them to meet you as it would be for a four-year-old to meet them. A layer cake of generations.  As we\\'re talking today three of the Top Six here [England] are by them, which is the greatest chart domination by a group since 1964. They\\'re very liked here by a lot of the record buyers, which in Britain are the young kids.  From your personal experience, do you think they can understand how much they mean to people? Sure they know, sure. I think Little Jimmy probably knows less than the others what\\'s going on, but they seem to. They\\'ve got that kind of American showbiz family feeling, which does work. You can put it down, but it really does work. They\\'ve been doing it for years on The Andy Williams Show, and they\\'re troupers already. You know, the kid\\'s only eight or something, Little Jimmy, but he\\'s already a little trouper. He has what a seasoned performer has.  When you were in their position, did you feel a sense of responsibility, or did you feel the world had gone crazy? No, no. We were a band who\\'d been trying to make it big for a long time. When you\\'re trying to get to the top, when you start to get there, that\\'s probably the biggest thrill. You don\\'t think the whole world\\'s gone crazy; you think it\\'s great that they like you and you\\'re well-chuffed that you\\'re going down so well. That\\'s all that enters your head. I think that even Little Jimmy just thinks, \"Hey, man, that\\'s great, that\\'s far-out.\" You know? He just loves it. And that\\'s really the best way.  When you get thinking too heavily about all of this stuff, like anything, you can do so many doublethinks on it all you end up with is not liking it, which is the only hang up. When you end up not liking it then you start to do it less well. I always thought, just great, great band, great things, kids screaming, fantastic, fabulous, great, everyone\\'s having a good night out. That sort of thing, basically.   Were you frightened of possible negative reaction when you released your solo album, McCartney? It was your first break from the Beatles. I was as confident as I ever am about any LP. I realize it was more kind of throwaway and done at home than any of the previous ones, but that wasn\\'t a reason to worry about it. You never know what people are going to think about a record anyway.  The handout on the British edition of McCartney didn\\'t appear in America. Why was that? Linda and I did a mail-out from our house. We had made up this little interview for friends and the press and sent them out with about the first hundred albums. Somebody thought it was supposed to be a thing that came with the album, probably because we didn\\'t explain it in the mailing. We should have said. \"Enclosed find press kit.\" People got the idea it came with the album, but it didn\\'t come out in Britain in the copies in the stores.  I had asked Peter Brown [of Apple] for a list of questions he thought might have interesting answers. Looking back, it seems a bit blunt and weird, but at the time it wasn\\'t meant to be. Things like, \"Are you gonna be another John and Yoko?\" \"No, we\\'re gonna be a Paul and Linda.\" Little silly things like that.  How did you feel people would react to Linda\\'s presence? She was on Let It Be doing backup vocals. That was her first appearance, and nobody said much about that. The time we did McCartney, as it was largely recorded in the back room, she was always there. That was how she came to be on the album as much as she was.  You did have the release date close to Let It Be. There was some hassle at the time. We were arguing over who had mentioned a release date first. It was all a bit petty. I\\'d pegged a release date and then Let It Be was scheduled near it. I saw it as victimization, but now I\\'m sure it wasn\\'t.  Seeing that Let It Be was released basically after the fact, do you wish it had not been released? Oh, no. I don\\'t wish that about anything. Everything seems to take its place in history after it\\'s happened and it\\'s fine to let it stay there.  It was the first album to have the little bits on, like the type that also appeared on McCartney. I rather fancied having just the plain tapes and nothing done to them at all. We had thought of doing something looser before, but the albums always turned out to be well-produced. That was the idea of the whole album. All the normal things that you record that are great and have all this atmosphere but aren\\'t brilliant recordings or production jobs normally are left out and wind up on, say, Pete Townshend\\'s cutting floor. It ends up with the rest of his demos.  But all that stuff is often stuff I love. It\\'s got the door opening, the banging of the tape recorder, a couple of people giggling in the background. When you\\'ve got friends around, those are the kind of tracks you play them. You don\\'t play them the big finished produced version.  Like \"Hey Jude,\" I think I\\'ve got that tape somewhere, where I\\'m going on and on with all these funny words. I remember I played it to John and Yoko and I was saying, \"these words won\\'t be on the finished version.\" Some of the words were \"the movement you need is on your shoulder,\" and John was saying, \"It\\'s great! \\'The movement you need is on your shoulder.\\' \" I\\'m saying, \"It\\'s crazy, it doesn\\'t make any sense at all.\" He\\'s saying, \"Sure it does, it\\'s great.\" I\\'m always saying that, by the way, that\\'s me, I\\'m always never sure if it\\'s good enough. That\\'s me, you know.  So when McCartney came along I had all these rough things and I liked them all and thought, well, they\\'re rough, but they\\'ve got that certain kind of thing about them, so we\\'ll leave it and just put it out. It\\'s not an album which was really sweated over, and yet now I find it\\'s a lot of people\\'s favorite. They think it\\'s great to hear the kids screaming and the door opening, it\\'s lovely.  The first of your albums with some of those little bitsy things was \\'Let It Be.\\' Had you wanted to do that before? Yes, I think so. In the back of everyone\\'s mind there was always that kind of thing. The sound of a tape being spooled back is an interesting sound. If you\\'re working in a recording studio, you hear it all the time and get used to it. You don\\'t think anything of it. But when the man switches on the tape machine in the middle of a track and you hear that kind of djeeoww, and then \u2013 the track starts, I\\'d always liked all that, all those rough edges and loose ends. It gives it a kind of live excitement.  When you do have rough edges on an album, you\\'re open to interpretation. There\\'s the famous example of John and Yoko\\'s \\'Wedding Album,\\' where the reviewer reviewed the tone on the test pressing and said that the subtle fluctuations in this tone were very arty. The whole analysis business is a funny business, it\\'s almost like creating history before it\\'s been created. When a thing happens you immediately start analyzing it as if it was 50 years ago, as if it was King Henry VIII who said it. It is daft, actually, but you can\\'t blame anyone for doing it, they\\'ve got to write something. Unless they can say \"I was around at his house and he gave me a nice cup of tea ... funny little blue cups he gave it in ...\" they\\'ve got to say, well, what did you mean by this, or what was that tone.  With one song you mentioned just a few minutes ago, \"Hey Jude,\" everyone was trying to figure out who Jude was. I happened to be driving out to see Cynthia Lennon. I think it was just after John and she had broken up, and I was quite mates with Julian [their son]. He\\'s a nice kid, Julian. And I was going out in me car just vaguely singing this song, and it was like \"Hey Jules.\" I don\\'t know why, \"Hey Jules.\" It was just this thing, you know, \"Don\\'t make it bad/ Take a sad song ...\" And then I just thought a better name was Jude. A bit more country & western for me.  Once you get analyzing something and looking into it, things do begin to appear and things do begin to tie in. Because everything ties in, and what you get depends on your approach to it. You look at everything with a black attitude and it\\'s all black.  This other idea of Paul Is Dead. That was on for a while. I had just turned up at a photo session and it was at the time when Linda and I were just beginning to knock around with each other steadily. It was a hot day in London, a really nice hot day, and I think I wore sandals. I only had to walk around the corner to the crossing because I lived pretty nearby. I had me sandals on and for the photo session I thought I\\'ll take my sandals off.  Linda: No, you were barefoot.  Paul: Oh, I was barefoot. Yeah, that\\'s it. You know, so what? Barefoot, nice warm day, I didn\\'t feel like wearing shoes. So I went around to the photo session and showed me bare feet. Of course when that comes out and people start looking at it they say, \"Why has he got no shoes on? He\\'s never done that before.\" OK, you\\'ve never seen me do it before, but, in actual fact, it\\'s just me with my shoes off. Turns out to be some old Mafia sign of death or something.  Then the this-little-bit-if-you-play-it-backwards stuff. As I say, nine times out of ten it\\'s really nothing. Take the end of Sgt. Pepper, that backward thing, \"We\\'ll fuck you like Supermen.\" Some fans came around to my door giggling. I said, \"Hello, what do you want?\" They said, \"Is it true, that bit at the end? Is it true? It says \\'We\\'ll fuck you like Supermen.\\'\" I said, \"No, you\\'re kidding. I haven\\'t heard it, but I\\'ll play it.\" It was just some piece of conversation that was recorded and turned backwards. But I went inside after I\\'d seen them and played it studiously, turned it backwards with my thumb against the motor, turned the motor off and did it backwards. And there it was, sure as anything, plain as anything. \"We\\'ll fuck you like Supermen.\" I thought, Jesus, what can you do?  And then there was \"I buried Paul.\" That wasn\\'t \"I buried Paul\" at all, that was John saying \"cranberry sauce.\" It was the end of \"Strawberry Fields.\" That\\'s John\\'s humor. John would say something totally out of synch, like \"cranberry sauce.\" If you don\\'t realize that John\\'s apt to say \"cranberry sauce\" when he feels like it, then you start to hear a funny little word there, and you think \"Aha!\"  When you were alive and presumed dead, what did you think? Someone from the office rang me up and said, \"Look, Paul, you\\'re dead.\" And I said, \"Oh, I don\\'t agree with that.\" And they said, \"Look, what are you going to do about it? It\\'s a big thing breaking in America. You\\'re dead.\" And so I said leave it, just let them say it. It\\'ll probably be the best publicity we\\'ve ever had and I won\\'t have to do a thing except stay alive. So I managed to stay alive through it.  A couple of people came up and said, \"Can I photograph you to prove you\\'re not dead?\" Coincidentally, around about that time, I was playing down a lot of the old Beatle image and getting a bit more to what I felt was me, letting me beard grow and not being so hung up on keeping fresh and clean. I looked different, more laid back, and so I had people coming up saying \"You\\'re not him!\" And I was beginning to think, \"I am, you know, but I know what you mean. I don\\'t look like him, but believe me.\"  You were supposedly Billy Shears, according to one of the theories. Ringo\\'s Billy Shears. Definitely. That was just in the production of Sgt. Pepper. It just happened to turn out that we dreamed up Billy Shears. It was a rhyme for \"years\" ... \"band you\\'ve known for all these years ... and here he is, the one and only Billy Shears.\" We thought, that\\'s a great little name, it\\'s an Eleanor-Rigby-type name, a nice atmospheric name, and it was leading into Ringo\\'s track. So as far as we were concerned it was purely and simply a device to get the next song in.   Your two big television shows were the James Paul McCartney and The Magical Mystery Tour shows. How were these conceived? The Mystery show was conceived way back in Los Angeles. On the plane. You know they give you those big menus and I had a pen and everything and started drawing on this menu and I had this idea. In England they have these things called Mystery tours. And you go on them and you pay so much and you don\\'t know where you\\'re going. So the idea was to have this little thing advertised in the shop windows somewhere called Magical Mystery Tours. Someone goes in and buys a ticket and rather than just being the kind of normal publicity hype of magical ... well, it never is magical, really ... the idea of the show was that it was actually a magical run \u2013 a real magical trip.  I did a few little sketches myself and everyone else thought up a couple of little things. John thought of a little thing and George thought of a scene and we just kind of built it up. Then we hired a coach and picked actors out of an actor\\'s directory and we just got them all along with the coach and we said, \"OK, act.\" An off-the-cuff kind of thing.  The James Paul McCartney show were these people who wanted us to do a TV show and they said they wanted a nice show and said you can do it any way you want. This seemed like a good opportunity, you know, to kinda get on the telly. So that one was just worked up that way. We met the guy when we went to Morocco. We were on holiday then and they came out and we sat around the pool and talked about various ideas and came back to England and did it.  Were you sorry The Magical Mystery Tour was not shown in America? At the time, hey, I thought, \"Oh, blimey,\" but ... eh ... it started out to be one of those kind of things. Like The Wild One, you know, Marlon Brando ... at the time it couldn\\'t be released. The interest in it came later. The interest started to grow, you know. Magical Mystery Show was a bit like that ... well, whatever happened to it ... that\\'s a bit magical itself. Like the Stones\\' Rock and Roll Circus. You know, what happened to that, you know. I mean, I\\'d like to see that. So all of those things work out well. You\\'ve got to be patient. Everything like that works out well. I think it was a good show. It will have its day, you know.  There was an interesting reaction to James Paul McCartney. Some people liked some parts and didn\\'t like others. I can understand that. You know, I think a lot of people thought we could have done more ... could have done a better show. It was a little bitty [disjointed]. That was a fair comment, but I got a lot of letters from people, you know, just people, old people, from like Red Creek, Minnesota, just saying, \"Hey man, dug the show, you know.\"  You told me you still ask your friends, \"Is this really good?\" And Linda mentioned that you still get nervous about the work. And so does this mean you watch critical notices very closely? No, I don\\'t like criticism whatever. I don\\'t think I ever liked it when my dad said, I don\\'t like your trousers. But I went through a difficult period where I started to listen to what the newspapers have to say ... about me ... and say, some guy would be sittin\\' in New York all hung up thinking, \"Well, that\\'s not as good as I woulda wanted.\" And I thought, \"Well, blimey, that\\'s only one guy. I\\'m not going to take it as gospel.\"  Linda mentioned you \"bounce off\" people. After you left George Martin and the other three, was Linda the only person to bounce your ideas off of? For a while, yes. Oh yes.  Did you miss not having more people? Is there anyone you ask now outside of people in the band? Sometimes now I mainly bounce off myself. I do that more now, call it what you will \u2013 maturity? Sometimes if a friend is in the studio I\\'ll ask for their opinion and that will make it easier on me. The laugh of all this is I say all this rubbish and it all changes the next day.  I still read the notices and stuff and they\\'re usually bum ones when you\\'re expecting them to be great. Like after Ram, there were a lot of bum notices after Ram. But I keep meetin\\' people wherever I go, like I met someone skiing. As he skiied past me he said, \"I loved Ram, Paul.\" So that\\'s really what I go by. Just the kind of people who flash by me in life. Just ordinary people and they said they loved it. That\\'s why I go a lot by sales, not just for the commercial thing. Like if a thing sells well, it means a lot of people bought it and liked it.  Does that mean, then, that you didn\\'t think too much in retrospect of \\'Wild Life\\'? Because of all your albums ... No, ah, I quite liked it. I must say you have to like me to like the record. I mean, if it\\'s just taken cold, I think it wasn\\'t that brilliant as a recording. We did it in about two weeks, the whole thing. And it had been done on that kind of a buzz we\\'d been hearing about how Dylan had come in and done everything in one take. I think in fact often we never gave the engineer a chance to even set up a balance. There\\'s a couple of real big songs on there, that only freaks or connoisseurs know.  Well, \"Tomorrow.\" Yeah, \"Tomorrow\" is one of them. It\\'s like, when I\\'m talking to people about Picasso or something and they say, well, his blue period was his only one that was any good. But for me, if the guy does some great things then even his downer moments are interesting. His lesser moments, rather, because they make up the final picture. Some moments seem less, he was going through kind of a pressure period. You know, you can\\'t live your life without pressure periods. No one I know has.  You mentioned Dylan sort of being an inspiration for doing \\'Wild Life\\' the way you did it ... He\\'s going on the road, of course, this month. With the Band ...  Does this in any way motivate you, inspire you? No, not particularly. I mean, I\\'ve just been on the road last year, so my being ... doing that just might have inspired him; I don\\'t know, you know. He\\'s a great guy, Dylan; he\\'s a musician, and stuff, and he\\'s a great spirit. Love him, you know.  Do you think he influenced you at all? Oh, yes. Very heavily.  I think the first time was in \"You\\'ve Got to Hide Your Love Away.\" That was John\\'s song. Then there was a good deal of influence in the Hard Day\\'s Night and Help! periods. Certain chords, the acoustic bit. We liked him.  We met him when we came to New York and we were together awhile. He came to one of my sessions when I was doing Ram in New York.  You mentioned in the studio that you were influenced in a recent session by Marvin Gaye\\'s \"Trouble Man.\" Do you think Fela or someone else might misconstrue this? Being influenced by something and stealing something are two different things. When you hear the track we did and hear Marvin Gaye\\'s you probably would never know they were related. I may be influenced by something, but it\\'s in my head and doesn\\'t necessarily show in the song. \"Here, There and Everywhere\" was supposed to be a Beach Boys song, but you wouldn\\'t have known.  \"Hi Hi Hi\" was the one that brought you back to the Top Ten, after \"Give Ireland Back to the Irish\" and \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" although in Britain they played \"C Moon\" because \"Hi Hi Hi\" was banned by the BBC. I thought the \"Hi Hi Hi\" thing could easily be taken as a natural high, could be taken as booze high and everything. It doesn\\'t have to be drugs, you know, so I\\'d kind of get away with it. Well, the first thing they saw was drugs, so I didn\\'t get away with that, and then I just had some line \"Lie on the bed and get ready for my polygon.\"  The daft thing about all of that was our publishing company, Northern Songs, owned by Lew Grade, got the lyrics wrong and sent them round to the radio station and it said, \"Get ready for my body gun,\" which is far more suggestive than anything I put. \"Get ready for my polygon,\" watch out baby, I mean it was suggestive, but abstract suggestive, which I thought I\\'d get away with. Bloody company goes round and makes it much more specific by putting \"body gun.\" Better words, almost.  It made it anyway in the States. Yeah, well, the great laugh is when we go live, it makes a great announcement. You can say \"This one was banned!\" and everyone goes \"Hooray!\" The audience love it, you know. \"This next one was banned,\" and then you get raving, because everyone likes to. Everyone\\'s a bit anti-all-that-banning, all that censorship. Our crew, our generation, really doesn\\'t dig that stuff, as I\\'m sure you know.  \"Helen Wheels\" has done better in America than England, as have many of your records past, back to the old days. Have you ever thought of a reason why? The only thing I can think of is the foreigner syndrome. We\\'re British, and that means something to an American. It\\'s like some Americans who do better over here, like Cassidy and the Osmonds, even Elvis.  It\\'s been suggested that the Beatles provided something for Americans they had lost with the death of Kennedy \u2013 youth, happiness, freedom from inhibitions. Does that make much sense to you? No, none at all.  In songwriting technique, how did you compose with John? How did you compose yourself and then with Linda? Well, first, I started off on my own. Very early on I met John, and we then, gradually, started to write stuff together. Which didn\\'t mean we wrote everything together. We\\'d kind of write 80% together and the other 20% for me were things like \"Yesterday\" and for John things like \"Strawberry Fields\" that he\\'d mainly write on his own. And I did certain stuff on my own. So I\\'ve done stuff on my own.  When I said how do you compose, I meant actually sitting down and doing it. Did you use guitar, or did you use piano? When I first started writing songs I started using a guitar. The first one I ever wrote was one called \"My Little Girl\" which is a funny little song, a nice little song, a corny little song based on three chords \u2013 G, G7 and C. A little later we had a piano and I used to bang around on that. I wrote \"When I\\'m Sixty-Four\" when I was about 16. I wrote the tune for that and I was vaguely thinking then it might come in handy in a musical comedy or something. I didn\\'t know what kind of career I was going to take.  So I wrote that on piano and from there it\\'s really been a mixture of the both. I just do either, now. Sometimes I\\'ve got a guitar in my hands; sometimes I\\'m sittin\\' at a piano. It depends whatever instrument I\\'m at \u2013 I\\'ll compose on it, you know.  Do you start with a title or a line, or what? Oh, different ways. Every time it\\'s different. \"All My Loving\" \u2013 an old Beatle song, remember that one, folks? \u2013 I wrote that one like a bit of poetry, and then I put a song to it later. Something like \"Yesterday,\" I did the tune first and wrote words to that later. I called that \"Scrambled Egg\" for a long time. I didn\\'t have any words to it. [Paul sings the melody with the words \"scrambled egg ... da da da da ... scrambled egg ...\"] So then I got words to that; so I say, every time is different, really. I like to keep it that way, too; I don\\'t get any set formula. So that each time, I\\'m pullin\\' it out of the air.  When did you get the idea you were going to bring in a string quartet on \"Scrambled Egg\"? First of all, I was just playing it through for everyone \u2013 saying, how do you like this song? I played it just me on acoustic, and sang it. And the rest of the Beatles said, \"That\\'s it. Love it.\" So George Martin and I got together and sort of cooked up this idea. I wanted just a small string arrangement. And he said, \"Well, how about your actual string quartet?\" I said great, it sounds great. We sat down at a piano and cooked that one up.  How would you see George Martin\\'s contributions in those songs in those days? George\\'s contribution was quite a big one, actually. The first time he really ever showed that he could see beyond what we were offering him was \"Please Please Me.\" It was originally conceived as a Roy Orbison-type thing, you know. George Martin said, \"Well, we\\'ll put the tempo up.\" He lifted the tempo and we all thought that was much better and that was a big hit. George was in there quite heavily from the beginning.  The time we got offended, I\\'ll tell you, was one of the reviews, I think about Sgt. Pepper \u2013 one of the reviews said, \"This is George Martin\\'s finest album.\" We got shook; I mean, \"We don\\'t mind him helping us, it\\'s great, it\\'s a great help, but it\\'s not his album, folks, you know.\" And there got to be a little bitterness over that. A bit help, but Christ, if he\\'s goin\\' to get all the credit ... for the whole album ... [Paul plays with his children.]   The Wings tour in 1972 was the first time you had toured in six years, wasn\\'t it? Yes.  Had you intended to keep it that long? Oh, no, no, no. With the Beatles we did a big American tour, and. I think the feeling, mainly from George and John, was, \"Oh, this is getting a little bit uhhh ...\" But I thought, \"No, you can\\'t give up live playing, we\\'d be crazy to.\" But then we did a concert tour I really hated and I came off stormy and saying, \"Bloody hell, I really agree with you now.\"  Where was that? In America, somewhere, I can\\'t remember exactly. It was raining and we were playing under some sort of big canopy and everybody felt they were going to get electric shocks and stuff. We were driven off in a big truck afterwards and I remember sitting in the back of the truck saying, bloody hell, they\\'re right, this is stupid.  So we knew we were going to give up playing but we didn\\'t want to go make some big announcement, that we were giving it all up or anything, so we just kind of cooled it and didn\\'t go out. When anyone asked we\\'d say, \"Oh, we\\'ll be going out again,\" but we really didn\\'t think we would. So we recorded a lot and stuff and nobody felt the need to go out and play.  After six years I just thought it would be good to get out, because live shows are a lot of what it\\'s about. If nothing else, you get out there and see what people want. I remember at the end of the Beatles thinking that it would be good if I just went out with some country & western group. To have a sing every day surely must improve my voice a bit.  When you did start to play live again, were you very nervous? Yes. Very nervous. The main thing I didn\\'t want to face was the torment of five rows of press people with little pads all looking and saying, \"Oh, well, he\\'s not as good as he was.\" So we decided to go out on that university tour, which made me less nervous because it was less of a big deal. We went out on that tour and by the end of that I felt quite ready for something else, and we went to Europe. I was pretty scared on the Europe tour. That was a bit more of a big deal, here he is, ladies and gentlemen, sold all the tickets out ... I had to go on with a band I really didn\\'t know much. We decided not to do any Beatle material, which was a killer, of course, because it meant we had to do an hour of other material, and we didn\\'t have it, then. I didn\\'t have something like \"My Love\" that was sort of mine. I felt like everyone wanted Beatles stuff, so I was pretty nervous on that.  But by the end of the Europe tour I felt better, and at the end of the British tour I felt good. By the time we did the British tour I knew we could get it easily and that I could get it going. Everyone digs it, and there\\'s enough stuff not to be nervous.  On the Wings tour the one song you did from the past was \"Long Tall Sally.\" The first time I ever sang on a stage I did \"Long Tall Sally.\" I must have been pretty young, probably 14; I feel like I might have been 11, I don\\'t know. We went to stay with our parents at a holiday camp called Butlins, a branch in Wales. They used to have these talent shows, and one of my cousins-in-law was one of the red coats who had something to do with the entertainment. He called us up on the stage, I had my guitar with me. Looking back on it, it must have been a put-up job, I don\\'t know what I was doing there with my guitar. I probably asked him to get me up or something. I went up with my brother Mike, who had just recovered from breaking his arm and looked all pale. He had his arm in a big sling. We used to do an Everly Brothers number, something like \"Bye Bye Love.\" I think it might have been \"Bye Bye Love,\" in fact. We did that, and then I finished with \"Long Tall Sally.\"  Ever since I heard Little Richard\\'s version, I started imitating him. It was just straight imitation, really, which has gradually become my version of it as much as Richard\\'s. I started doing it in one of the classrooms at school, it was just one of the imitations I could do well. I could do Fats Domino, I could do Elvis, I could do a few people. [Smiles.] I still can! \"I\\'m walking, yes indeed, I\\'m ...\" [Does Fats Domino impersonation.] \"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.\" [An Elvis impersonation.] That\\'s Elvis.  Did many of those black artists appeal to you in the late Fifties and early Sixties? John did several Motown songs. Yes, very much. I loved all that stuff. Those were my favorites, definitely.  When did you first think you wanted to be in a band? I didn\\'t think I wanted to be in one; I wanted to do something in music and my dad gave me a trumpet, for my birthday. I went through trying to learn that. But my mouth used to get too sore. You know, you have to go through a period of gettin\\' your lip hard. I suddenly realized I wouldn\\'t be able to sing if I played trumpet. So I figured guitar would be better. It was about the time that guitar was beginning to be the instrument. So I went and swapped my trumpet for a guitar and I got that home and couldn\\'t figure out what was wrong and I suddenly decided to turn the strings around and that made a difference and I realized I was left-handed. I started from there, really; that was my first kind of thing, and then once you had a guitar you were then kind of eligible for bands and stuff. But I never thought of myself being in a band.  One day I went with this friend of mine. His name was Ivan [Vaughn]. And I went up to Woolton, in Liverpool, and there was a village fete on, and John and his friends were playing for the thing. My friend Ivan knew John, who was a neighbor of his. And we met there and John was onstage singing \"Come little darlin\\', come and go with me...\"  The Del Vikings\\' \"Come Go With Me\"? But he never knew the words because he didn\\'t know the record, so he made up his own words, like \"down, down, down, down, to the penitentiary.\" I remember I was impressed. I thought, wow, he\\'s good. That\\'s a good band there. So backstage, back in the church hall later, I was singing a couple of songs I\\'d known.  I used to know all the words to \"Twenty Flight Rock\" and a few others and it was pretty much in those days to know the words to that. John didn\\'t know the words to many songs. So I was valuable. I wrote up a few words and showed him how to play \"Twenty Flight Rock\" and another one, I think. He played all this stuff and I remember thinking he smelled a bit drunk. Quite a nice chap, but he was still a bit drunk. Anyway, that was my first introduction, and I sang a couple of old things.  I liked their band, and then one of their friends who was in the band, a guy called Pete Shotton who was a friend of John\\'s, saw me cycling up in Woolton one day and said, \"Hey, they said they\\'d quite like to have you in the band, if you\\'d like to join.\" I said, \"Oh, yeah, it\\'d be great.\" We then met up somewhere and I was in the band.  I was originally on guitar. The first thing we had was at a Conservative Club somewhere in Broadway, which is an area of Liverpool, as well as New York. There was a Conservative Club there and I had a big solo, a guitar boogie. I had this big solo and it came to my bit and I blew it. I blew it. Sticky fingers, you know. I couldn\\'t play at all and I got terribly embarrassed. So I goofed that one terribly, so from then on I was on rhythm guitar. Blown out on lead!  We went to Hamburg, and I had a real cheap guitar, an electric guitar. It finally blew up on me, it finally fell apart in Hamburg. It just wasn\\'t used to being used like that. Then I was on piano for a little while. So I went from bass to lead guitar to rhythm guitar to piano. I used to do a few numbers like Ray Charles\\' \"Don\\'t Let the Sun Catch You Crying\" and a couple of Jerry Lee Lewis\\' like \"High School Confidential.\"  Then Stuart [Sutcliffe] left the group. He was the bass player. He lent me his bass, and I played bass for a few weeks. I used to play it upside down. And he used to have piano strings on it, because you couldn\\'t get bass strings. They were a bit rare, you know, and they cost a lot, too, about \u00a22 for one string. So he would cut these big lengths of piano strings from the piano and wind them on this guitar. So I played that upside down for a while. I\\'m pretty versatile, I\\'ll give that to myself. I wasn\\'t very good, but I was versatile.  I\\'m in Hamburg, and I have a little bit of money together, and finally saved enough money to buy myself a Hoffman violin bass. It was my bass, then, that was the one. And I became known for that bass, a lot of kids got them. That was my big pride and joy, because it sounded great.  And that was it, basically. The rest you know.  In America, the anthology album [Beatles 1967-70] and Red Rose Speedway were back to back Number Ones. You were replacing yourself. Did that strike you as odd? I thought it was good, rather than odd, because obviously the big hang up after the Beatles broke up was, and really still is, can any of them be as good as the unit? The answer in most people\\'s minds, I think, is \"No. They can\\'t.\" Because the unit was so good.  Were you glad those anthology albums were released for the historical record or to combat the bootleggers? The bootlegging thing was one of the reasons. I didn\\'t take an awful lot of interest in them, actually. I still haven\\'t heard them. I know what\\'s on them because I\\'ve heard it all before, you know. I haven\\'t really taken much interest in Beatles stuff of late just because there has been this hangover of Apple and Klein. The whole scene has gone so bloody sick. The four ex-Beatles are totally up to here with it. Everyone wants it solved so everyone can get on with being a bit peaceful with each other.  There was a lawsuit recently, the three others against Klein. Of course I loved that. My God, I hope they win that one. That\\'s great. You see, apart from everything that went down, all the little personal conflicts, the reason why I felt I had to do what I had to do, which ended up specifically as being I had to sue the other three, was that there was no way I could sue Klein on his own, which is what I wanted to do. It took me months to get over the fact. I kept saying, I can\\'t sue the other three, just because it\\'s very hard news to go suing someone you like, and no matter what kind of personal things were going down and John writing songs about me and all that stuff, I still didn\\'t feel like the coolest thing in the world was to go and sue them. But it actually turned out to be the only way to stop Klein, so I had to go and do it.  Then it all started to come out, you know, that Klein had persuaded George \u2013 I don\\'t know how much of this is libelous \u2013  Our lawyers will take out whatever is libelous. Klein made his way into George\\'s big songwriting company, which is George\\'s big asset. The main one was the song \"Something,\" that was on Abbey Road. That was kind of George\\'s great big song, George\\'s first big effort, and everyone covered it and it was lovely and made him lots of money that he could give away, which is his thing, you know. It was a great thing for him. Well, it turns out that Klein has got himself into that company. Not only paid 20% [the percentage Klein claimed to have gotten from Abbey Road] \u2013 there\\'s a thought now that he\\'s claiming he owns the company!  It\\'s those kinds of little weird trips. Now the only good thing I feel is that I wasn\\'t wrong. I would have felt really bad if I was wrong and the guy was really a goodie all along and I\\'d gone and stuck my big nose in there like the pot calling the kettle black. But it turns out he is the type of man who wants to own it for himself and not the type of man who believes the artist should have it and do what he wants with it, which is what I believe.  He was once quoted in New York magazine as saying he was going to roast your ass. Yeah, well, he never did, you know, and that\\'s cool. He wouldn\\'t get near my ass to roast it, anyway. Punk. You mentioned you had to sue the other three to get at Klein. What was Klein doing that made you have to sue? Basically, I was being held to my obligations under an old contract. I would have to just sit, lump it, and let him be my manager, which I didn\\'t want.  So I was told I could sue him. I said, \"Great, I\\'ll sue him.\" Then they said, \"There\\'s one catch, you have to sue Apple\" \u2013 and that meant suing the other three. For two months I sat around thinking, \"I can\\'t do this.\" Not that I didn\\'t see the others. I did, and kept asking them to let me out and they said, \"No, Allen says there would be tax complications.\" I said, \"I don\\'t give a damn about tax considerations, let me go and I\\'ll worry about the tax considerations. I didn\\'t want to be an ABKCO-Managed Industry.\" It was weird. My albums would come out saying \"An ABKCO Company,\" and he wasn\\'t even my manager.  As it turns out, it was the best thing, because that got the receiver in there and froze the money and gave everybody time to think about it. He\\'s still managed to get $5 million transferred to his own company, five million for management [the exact amount is subject matter of present litigation].  He has a very special gift for talking his way. He\\'ll use his Playboy interviews, and he\\'ll probably ask for a Rolling Stone interview after mine. Even a murderer has a great line in his own defense. But he\\'s nothing more than a trained New York crook. John said, \"Anyone whose record is as bad as this can\\'t be so bad.\" But that was Lennon-esque crap, which John occasionally did; utter foolishness. Klein had already been convicted on ten counts of income tax. [Criminal docket 66-72 of US District Court, Southern District of New York, shows one Allen Klein found guilty January 29th, 1971, on ten counts of \"unlawfully failing to make & file returns of Federal income taxes and FICA taxes withheld from employees\\' wages.\" Conviction affirmed on appeal by US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit November 19th, 1971.] Somebody who\\'s been convicted ten times can\\'t be all clean. [Growing more emotional] My back was against the wall. I\\'m not proud of it. But it had to be done. To him, artists are money. To me, they\\'re more than that.  If Klein was the big reason for the breakup of Apple, do you think there would have been difficulties anyway without him? I think there would have been difficulties. Had the Eastmans come in like I wanted, the others would have feared I was trying to screw everyone for the Eastmans. It would have been a bit hard for the others to swallow, I\\'m afraid, since the Eastmans were so close to me. But they didn\\'t want to screw anybody, and the way it\\'s turning out they\\'re settling up most of it anyway. Some people say, \"People are all the same in business,\" but they\\'re not.  I think the Apple thing was great. As it turned out, the one thing about business is that it does have to be looked after. If you have paperwork and bills and royalties and accounts and stuff, they all have to be handled very well, or else things get lost and then accountants have great difficulty in making up the final picture for taxes.  Apple was together in a lot of other ways. Although he didn\\'t get treated brilliantly at Apple, it was right for James Taylor to make his first record then. I think it was shameful of them to sue him afterwards, but I think that was largely Klein\\'s instigation because of the way he works. He\\'s kind of \"OK, git the bastard. He\\'s left us and he\\'s a success, let\\'s sue him. We got him, we got his contract.\"  But I still think all the records that came out of it, Billy Preston and James Taylor, Badfinger, Mary Hopkin, all the people we did take on all had very good records. George, even with the Radha Krishna Temple, I think that\\'s great stuff. I don\\'t think you can fault any of the artistic decisions. Looking back on it I think it was really a very successful thing.  The main downfall is that we were less businessmen and more heads, which was very pleasant and very enjoyable, except there should have been the man in there who would tell us to sign bits of paper. We got a man in who started to say, come on, sign it all over to me, which was the fatal mistake.  Just as I was going to do a radio show interview the other day, just as I was walking in, this feller walked up to me and said, \"Hello, Paul,\" and I thought I\\'d seen him somewhere before. He looked kind of middle-aged, 50ish, and I thought, \"What\\'s he want with me? Looks a bit dubious.\" He pushed a little bit of paper in me hand, he said, \"I don\\'t want to embarrass you, Paul, I\\'m sure you know what this is all about, but I\\'ve got my job to do.\" A wife and three kids, all that. So I walked on, muttering, looked at the bit of paper and it says \"ABKCO hereby sue you, John, George, Ringo and everything you\\'ve ever been connected with,\" in so many words, companies I\\'d never even heard of. \"Sue you all for the sum of $20 million.\" That is the latest little line.  I\\'m not trying to be immodest by classing myself with Van Gogh or with the biggies in the artistic world, but it is just a pure continuation of that kind of story. The whole idea of whoever makes the thing not being given the profits of it isn\\'t a new idea. I think it\\'s a joke, trying to sue us for that amount of money. It is just purely that he thinks, in some way, that he owns us. The laugh is that on that whole Klein thing there is one key thing which I luckily never would sign, so I feel a little bit out of that one, I must say.   Linda mentioned Lew Grade\\'s claim that she couldn\\'t write. That was an old one. Around that time we had millions of suits flying here, flying there, George wrote the \"Sue Me, Sue You Blues\" about it. I\\'d kicked it all off originally, having to sue the other three Beatles in the High Court, and that opened Pandora\\'s box. After that everybody just seemed to be suing everybody.  Meanwhile Lew Grade suddenly saw his songwriting concessions, which he\\'d just paid an awful lot of money for, virtually to get hold of John and I, he suddenly saw that I was now claiming that I was writing half my stuff with Linda, and that if I was writing half of it she was entitled to a pure half of it, no matter whether she was a recognized songwriter or not. I didn\\'t think that was important, I thought that whoever I worked with, no matter what the method of collaboration was, that person, if they did help me on the song, should have a portion of the song for helping me. I think at the time their big organization suddenly thought, \"Hello, they\\'re pulling a fast one, they\\'re trying to get some of the money back,\" whereas in fact, it was the truth. So they slapped vast amounts on us, I can\\'t remember what.  I wrote Sir Lew Grade a long letter saying, \"Don\\'t you think I ought to be able to do this and do that and don\\'t you think I\\'ve done enough and don\\'t you think I\\'m OK, and \u2013 Hey, man, why have you gotta sue me?\" He wrote me back a very rational letter. I can\\'t remember exactly what it said, but it was a very nice letter. He\\'s actually OK, Lew, he\\'s all right.  You did a TV show for him. After it, yeah, that\\'s right. All the suits were dropped by then. Bit me tongue ...  When was the last time you saw George? George? It\\'s been a little while.  Had George invited you to the Bangla Desh benefit? George invited me, and I must say it was more than just visa problems. At the time there was the whole Apple thing. When the Beatles broke up, at first I thought, \"Right, broken up, no more messing with any of that.\" George came up and asked if I wanted to play Bangla Desh and I thought, blimey, what\\'s the point? We\\'re just broken up and we\\'re joining up again? It just seemed a bit crazy.  There were a lot of things that went down then, most of which I\\'ve forgotten now. I really felt annoyed \u2013 \"I\\'m not going to do that if he won\\'t bloody let me out of my contract.\" Something like that. For years there had been problems as to why the other three felt they couldn\\'t just rip up our partnership agreement. I thought it was crazy if we had split up as a band to have this piece of paper still going on. We were all tied into it and I wanted to break it up and they said, \"Tax, you can\\'t.\" Klein was saying, \"You can\\'t do it, lads, you\\'ve got to stay together,\" and I think I know why he was saying it. He was telling the others it was tax and it was impossible and stuff.  There was an awful lot of that, and a lot of what I did around about then was just out of bitterness at all that. I thought, \"This is crazy, no one likes me enough to just let me go, give me my little bit of the proceeds and let me split off.\" It was a little tit-for-tat, if you\\'re not going to do this for me, I\\'m not going to do that for you. I tend to see the others now just for business. It\\'s a bit daft, actually. That\\'s why I\\'m so hot to get these business things over with.  You were hoping to do it today, I gather. Yeah, there was a little thing ... you see, each time one of us will get hot for a meeting. Say me, I just got me visa and I got all hot for a meeting. I rang John up, and John was keen to do it. He was going to fly in today from L.A. to New York. Great! I was going to be here; John was going to be here. Then I rang Ringo, and Ringo couldn\\'t figure out what we were going to actually say, outside of \"Hi, there.\" And he didn\\'t want to come all the way to New York from England, he was just getting settled for Christmas. So he was a bit down on it, that kind of blew it out. Then I called John and he said he was talking to George and George was having some kind of visa problems. So it\\'s a bit difficult to get the four of us together. But it will happen soon.  Lee said that the show you\\'ll do for Phoenix House as part of the arrangement for your visa will be part of a tour. The only thing now, obviously, is that it\\'s dependent on getting a band together. If we can get something together in the early months of 1974, then we\\'re hoping to come to the States, do a nice tour here. The Phoenix House people helped to get me in. It\\'s a good cause. We just went down to see one of their branches in East Harlem, just now. It\\'s fantastic. I wasn\\'t thinking it would be much, I thought it would be a bit depressing. But it\\'s a beautiful place. There\\'s a lot of love in that place. And it\\'s not the kind of a state thing. There\\'s discipline, too, but the discipline comes out of love. That way no one minds the discipline. If you just start off with discipline and nothing else, a lot of the kids find it hard to do it. But they\\'re all very self-supporting now. It\\'s a great place, I must say. Anyone who\\'s in trouble with drugs, pills, junk or whatever, should take a look in the Phoenix House.  What was the reaction of the kids when you went in there? Great. We just shook hands. Their choir sang some songs and we went on a little tour of the house. There was a guy telling us about encounter meetings, how he was putting the bathroom in, doing all the plumbing himself \u2013 they\\'re all very proud, because they\\'re all people who almost messed up. They just made it, and most of them look like they can really go on to great strength because of it.  Would you like this to be a big proper tour or small, like your university tour? A big proper tour. I think if you\\'re coming to the States, you can\\'t do it funky. I don\\'t think I could, anyway. I think now I\\'ll be ready to do a big concert tour, although I find it hard to imagine at the moment.  Now that you\\'re in New York, I suppose the rumors will start again. There\\'ll be a Beatles reunion of some sort? Well, I must say, like as far as getting together as we were, as the Beatles were, I don\\'t think that\\'ll ever happen again. I think now everyone\\'s kind of interested in their little personal things. I kind of like the way we did Band on the Run, the way we did it. Something we\\'ve never done before, and it\\'s very interesting. But I do think that I for one am very proud \u2013 although I don\\'t like the word proud, it tends to be \u2013 ex-servicemen have used the word ... if you know what I mean ... \"proud of my country\" ... but I will use the word \u2013 I am proud of the Beatle thing. It was great and I can go along with all the people you meet on the street who say you gave so much happiness to many people. I don\\'t think that\\'s corny. At the time obviously it just passes over; you don\\'t really think they mean it. Oh, yeah, sure, and you shake their hand or whatever.  But I dig all that like mad now, and I believe that we did bring a real lot of happiness to the times. So I\\'m very proud of that kind of stuff and consequently I wouldn\\'t like to see my past slagged off. So I would like to see more cooperation.... if things go right, if things keep cool, I\\'d like to maybe do some work with them; I\\'ve got a lot of ideas in my head what I\\'d like, but I wouldn\\'t like to tell you before I tell them. We couldn\\'t be the Beatles-back-together again, but there might be things, little good ventures we could get together on, mutually helpful to all of us and things people would like to see, anyway.  I wouldn\\'t rule everything out, it\\'s one of those questions I really have to hedge on. But, I mean, I\\'m ready. Once we settle our business crap \u2013 there was an awfully lot of money made, of course, and none of it came to us, really, in the end. Virtually, that\\'s the story. So I\\'d kind of like to salvage some of that and see that not everything\\'s ripped off.  Through all that kind of bitterness I tended to think like John a bit, \"Oh, the Beatles ... naww ... Crap.\" But it really wasn\\'t. I think it was great. So I\\'d like to see that cooled out and restored to its kind of former greatness, agree that it was a good thing and continue in some kind of way. I don\\'t see gettin\\' the Beatles back together \u2013 there\\'s certain things we could do quite quietly and still produce some kind of ongoing thing. I don\\'t think you\\'ll ever get anyone to give up all their individual stuff now; everyone\\'s got it going too well now.  Would you consider the Ringo album an example of that type of cooperation? Yeah, but I think more than that ... I think that\\'s a beginning; that shows what someone can do just if he asks. That\\'s all he did. He just asked us all. So that\\'s what I like, that no one says, \"Naw, you go on and make your own album.\" So if it\\'s that easy then lots of things could be done in the future. And I\\'d like to see some great things done.  This story is from the January 31st, 1974 issue of Rolling Stone. ',\n 'Weinstein Sues Weinstein Company, Demanding Access to Records  Harvey Weinstein, who was fired by the studio he had helped found after The New York Times revealed decades of sexual harassment allegations against him, sued the Weinstein Company on Thursday to demand access to records and emails.  The complaint, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, said Mr. Weinstein needed the materials to defend himself. More than 50 women have come forward in recent weeks to accuse Mr. Weinstein of sexual harassment or rape.  \u201cMr. Weinstein believes that his email account \u2014 which is the primary, if not only, account he used during the term of his employment by the company \u2014 will contain information exonerating him,\u201d the complaint said.  Mr. Weinstein also wants access to his former email account and other company documents, including his personnel file, to pursue a claim of wrongful termination against the Weinstein Company, according to the complaint. He also wants to pursue legal action against the studio \u201cfor mismanagement by leaking confidential company information\u201d \u2014 saying that certain news reports about his behavior \u201ccould have only come from his personnel file.\u201d  According to the filing, Mr. Weinstein is also seeking the materials to protect his 20 percent ownership stake in the studio by making sure it does not sell itself for a bargain price or make \u201cunjustified settlements\u201d with women who have made allegations against him. \u201cIf the board agrees to sell the company for less than it would be worth because of the threat of unsubstantiated or false allegations, Mr. Weinstein will receive less than he should have received,\u201d the complaint said.  Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Weinstein has repeatedly denied \u201cany allegations of nonconsensual sex.\u201d ',\n \"Ellen DeGeneres celebrates nine year wedding anniversary  She's known for her comedic routines and never-ending dance moves.

According to Entertainment Tonight, Chris Pratt was spotted at the Los Angeles parish of Hillsong Church, a hotspot that\\'s frequented by Bieber and Kourtney Kardashian. This is only the second Pratt sighting since the Guardians of the Galaxy star and his wife, Anna Faris, announced their separation after being married for eight years. Last month, Pratt made an appearance at the Teen Choice Awards, sans Faris, to accept the surfboard trophy for Choice Sci-Fi Movie Actor. While ET doesn\\'t mention whether or not the stars mingled or even knew that they were in the same congregation, Pratt attended the same evening service as both Bieber and Kardashian that night. ADVERTISEMENT  For those unfamiliar with the mega church that is Hillsong, it\\'s an Australian import and its pastor, Carl Lentz, is one of Bieber\\'s closest confidants. In addition to having services in Australia, the church has expanded with branches in New York City, Los Angeles, and London. Stars are flocking to the church and its parishioners include a slew of reality stars, such as the Kardashian-Jenner sisters; Nick Jonas; Bieber\\'s ex, Selena Gomez; and pro athletes such as Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.  According to People, Pratt \"redefined\" his connection to Christianity after the birth of his son, Jack, in 2012. He told the publication that he and Faris prayed extensively during Jack\\'s time in the NICU, since he was born nine weeks premature. Back in 2016, Pratt helped his pals place a huge cross on their property in Texas, telling Stephen Colbert on The Late Show that it was \"what Jesus was doing 2000-something years before on a Saturday before Easter, [he] was carrying a cross up a hill.\" ',\n 'Here\\'s What Happened When Kim Kardashian Finally Revealed Her Identity To Her Surrogate  Kim also explained in the interview why she didn\\'t invite the surrogate to her baby shower. (She has to explain to whole sitch to her kids first.) Overall, it sounds like Kim and her surrogate have a solid relationship.  And have ya ever wondered what it must be like for this anonymous woman to be carrying a child for two of the most famous people on the planet?  Well, Kim Kardashian stopped by The Real this week, and she revealed something surprising: Her surrogate had no idea whose baby she would be carrying at first.  \"She didn\\'t know at the beginning,\" Kim said. \"She didn\\'t know.\"   And Kim explained that she didn\\'t actually HAVE to tell her, if she didn\\'t want to: \"You could do it totally anonymously; you could go that route.\"   But she ultimately decided to let her surrogate know who she was.    \"I just felt like I wanted whoever\\'s carrying my baby...like, what if they weren\\'t a fan of me or my husband, and what if they didn\\'t want to be carrying our baby? I wanted to give them that choice.\"   \"I wanted a relationship with her,\" Kim concluded.   Kim also told the story of how the woman reacted when she finally found out who had hired her, and it all sounds pretty perfect: She was really excited. She was someone that had watched the show [Keeping Up With the Kardashians] \u2014 not like a superfan or anything. That it would\\'ve been uncomfortable \u2014 but she had seen my struggle and seen how open I was about it. So she was really proud to do it and really excited. Uh, can you even imagine???

Star magazine is reporting in their latest issue that A-list actress Cameron Diaz only uses bottled water to bathe.  \"Nothing but the best for Cameron, who has admitted to using only Evian water to wash her sensitive skin. Good thing she earns $18 million a movie!\"  RumorFix reached out to a friend of Cameron\\'s who gave us the real deal regarding the rumor. Asked if the Bad Teacher only used bottled water for bathing, we were told, \"No! Of course not.\"  We also did a little digging after the fact and discovered that back in 2000, Cam did once admit to using Evian water for washing her face, but not her entire body as indicated in the article. We can see how Star came to their conclusion, but it\\'s a total exagerration based off a statement made 11 years ago and now, just not true.

Barack and Michelle Obama have been keeping busy since leaving office nearly two months ago, and as the former president\\'s new go-to leather jacket might suggest, it\\'s been more play than work (although they\\'ve also managed to squeeze in book deals, surprise school visits and meetings on Obama\\'s presidential library and foundation).  As the former first couple have been settling into their new\\xa08,200-square-foot\\xa0home\\xa0in\\xa0Washington, D.C., they\\'ve been exploring the city in a whole new way, including a recent visit to the\\xa0National Gallery of Art that ended with a round of applause from fellow museum-goers.  This was also the first time Obama was spotted wearing his sleek brown leather jacket and new and improved dad jeans - both of which have earned rave reviews from the PEOPLE style team.  RELATED VIDEO: Barack Obama\\'s Favorite Jackets Have One Thing In Common  But the Obamas have\\xa0also been making plenty of time for travel.  Their adventures started on Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, when they took their final flight aboard an Air Force presidential jet -\\xa0straight to Palm Springs. After spending the weekend there with daughters Malia, 18, and Sasha, 15, the former president and first lady continued on their own to Richard Branson\\'s\\xa0private island retreat\\xa0in the British Virgin Islands.  The couple\\xa0spent 10 days on the Virgin Group founder\\'s Necker Island, where the former president tried kitesurfing for the first time - on a dare from his pal Branson.  \"We decided to set up a friendly challenge: could Barack learn to kitesurf before I learned to foilboard?\" Branson\\xa0wrote in a post on the Virgin website. \"We agreed to have a final day battle to see who could stay up the longest.\"  More recently, the Obamas visited New York City, where they had lunch with musician and activist Bono\\xa0at Upland restaurant in Manhattan.  A source told PEOPLE at the time that, as Bono and the Obamas walked out of the eatery, \"the whole restaurant stood up and applauded and cheered for them. Barack Obama waved at everyone upon leaving.\"  And as he has in\\xa0all of his post-White House outings, the former president looked relaxed and happy as he left the restaurant with a wide smile,\\xa0wearing a sleek black suit and white shirt with the top few buttons undone.  FROM COINAGE: This Is How Much It Would Cost to Paint the White House (And More Crazy Facts)  While in town, Obama also took his older daughter, Malia,\\xa0to dinner and a show. The father-daughter duo dined at Emilio\\'s Ballato, an Italian restaurant in Soho, before attending a revival of Arthur Miller\\'s\\xa0The Price on Broadway, starring Danny DeVito and Mark Ruffalo.  They even popped backstage to meet some of the stars.  Obama\\'s new life also gives him plenty of time for one of his favorite pastimes: golf. During his first post-presidency trip to his native Hawaii this week, Obama played a few rounds of golf at the Mid Pacific Country Club and took in a meal\\xa0at Buzz\\'s Steakhouse in Kailua - all with minimal security.  Obama wore a white polo and blue shorts for his golf outing, as well as his new favorite accessory: a\\xa0big grin.

Aside from staying off social media and out of the public eye for the last four months, a source told E!

',\n 'David Gest found dead at 62: Liza Minnelli\\'s ex husband discovered after \\'unexplained\\' death in London hotel  David Gest, the reality TV star and former husband of Liza Minnelli, has been found dead in a five-star London hotel in \"unexplained\" circumstances.  The 62-year-old music producer\\'s body was discovered at the luxury Four Seasons hotel, in Canary Wharf, on Tuesday morning.  Scotland Yard said the death of the star\\xa0- who was due to begin a UK tour of a\\xa0musical called David Gest Is Not Dead, But Alive With Soul this summer -\\xa0is \"unexplained\" and a post-mortem examination will be carried out.  Police were called to the hotel, in Westferry Circus, at about 10.15am.  Paramedics were called, but Gest was pronounced dead at the scene.  It is believed that Gest\\'s death is not being treated as suspicious and detectives are understood not to have found any obvious causes at the scene.  The former Celebrity Big Brother star was married to Minnelli from 2002-2003, but they only officially divorced in 2007.  Gest was also known for being a close friend of the late Michael Jackson.  The TV personality was a familiar face on British TV, appearing in I\\'m A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in 2006 and in Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year, which he exited after only 13 days due to ill health. He also appeared on ITV\\'s Grease Is The Word.  Gest was due to tour the United Kingdom in a musical show called David Gest Is Not Dead, But Alive With Soul, starting in York on July 1.  The name was inspired by an incident in the Celebrity Big Brother House when American reality star Tiffany Pollard mistakenly believed Gest had died rather than David Bowie. Friend Imad Handi said: \"It is with great sadness that I can confirm that David Gest has died today.  \"David was truly larger than life. He was not just a huge talent and a dear friend but a showbiz icon.  Mr Handi added: \"I know he will be missed by millions of fans around the world, and particularly in Britain, who came to love his charm and blistering one-liners.  \"If I may steal the words of one eminent critic, David was a natural star and a genuine celebrity. I will miss him desperately.\" Gest married Minnelli in March 2002 in a star-studded ceremony with Michael Jackson as best man and Elizabeth Taylor as maid of honour.  Before filing for divorce, Gest sued Minnelli for assault, claiming that she had beaten him so badly during alcoholic rages that she caused him nerve damage and caused him to be treated in hospital for five days.  Minnelli also sued Gest, claiming her estranged husband had stolen at least $2 million she earned while performing in shows he produced.  The pair ended their dispute in 2007 when their lawyers filed court papers saying they had settled their differences and agreed to get divorced without fault  Gest grew up with Jackson and his brothers in California, and was close friends with the family.  He was a successful producer and in 2001 his television special on the 30th anniversary of the launch of Jackson\\'s solo career was the highest rated in history.  In a recent interview with the BBC, ahead of one of his shows in Eastbourne, he spoke frankly about not wanting to be famous while he was married to Minnelli.  He said: \"There\\'s a part of me that never wanted to be quote \\'a celebrity\\' when I was married - I can\\'t remember the woman\\'s name.\"  Prompted by the interviewer that it was Minnelli, he responded: \"I knew it was Elizabeth. I never wanted to be in the public eye. It\\'s very hard when you wake up each day and there\\'s press outside your house.  \"I would never want to live that type of life, I live a very simple life.\"  Earlier this year, Gest spoke to The Grimsby Telegraph about where he wanted to be buried.  He said: \"I will never go back to LA; I will die here and want to be buried in York. I love this country much more than my own.\"  Celebrities\\' shock at death of \\'loyal dear friend\\'  Writing on Twitter, Myleene Klass described Gest as \"wonderfully kind\" and \"extremely generous\":',\n 'George Clooney, Amal Alamuddin and Famous Guests Kick Off Wedding Festivities in Venice  SEE 26 MORE CLOONEY WEDDING PHOTOS!

Here come the bride and groom!  George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin made a splash upon their arrival in Venice on Friday. The couple hopped aboard one of the city\\'s water taxis \u2013 fittingly named Amore \u2013 to arrive at the famed Belmond Hotel Cipriani, where they were hosting a small welcome gathering for friends attending their upcoming wedding.  Also taking water taxis for the glamorous festivities: Cindy Crawford and her husband Rande Gerber (the latter of whom has already made sure the celebrations will be well-stocked with tequila) and Matt Damon and his wife, Luciana.  A bar hall at the Cipriani was set aside for the welcome celebration, where Alamuddin, in a striped silk Dolce & Gabbana dress, and Clooney mingled with guests as they sipped Champagne and Bellinis. On Thursday gardeners at the hotel planted hundreds of white and pink Cyclamen blooms.  Other guests spotted arriving in Venice for the wedding include Clooney\\'s close friends, actors John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, Richard Kind and Ellen Barkin; his producing partner, Grant Heslov; and his cousin, NCIS: Los Angeles actor Miguel Ferrer, who RSVP\\'d very early.  Some family members started celebrating even earlier: Amal\\'s sister, Tala, was spotted dining with a small group of fellow wedding revelers at local restaurant Da Ivo, a longtime Clooney favorite, on Thursday night, followed by drinks at the Cipriani.  The wedding is already the talk of the town in Venice, a city used to famous visitors (Clooney is a regular at the annual film festival). \"Ever since he admitted he would be marrying in Venice a few weeks ago, everyone wants to be in on it,\" says local Liliana Sermonetta. \"Where are they staying, what are they eating, will they take a gondola ride? It\\'ll be difficult for Clooney to outdo Salma Hayek and Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault\\'s wedding. The whole of Hollywood moved here for three days!\"  The local government announced that the streets near the foot of the famous Rialto Bridge, in front of Ca\\'Farsetti, the town hall, are closed on Monday between 12 and 2 p.m. for Clooney\\'s wedding \u2013 likely for a civil ceremony following the weekend celebrations.  But potential gondola gridlock aside, Venetians are happy to host the famous couple. \"We are glad that George chose our beautiful city to finally tie the knot,\" says waiter Giorgio Valli. \"We wish him a long and happy marriage to his beautiful wife.\" ',\n 'Mariah Carey in talks for The X Factor - report  Mariah Carey is in talks to join The X Factor judging panel.  The Hero hitmaker is being lined up as a replacement for Nicole Scherzinger on the U.K. version of the singing competition, according to U.K. newspaper the Daily Mirror.  Producers at ITV have been in talks with the pop diva after the former Pussycat Doll is reportedly stalling over signing a new contract.  Mariah has previously served as a judge on American Idol, and with filming due to start in June (17), the 47-year-old is said to be \"really keen\".  \"Mariah really wants to do it. Nicole is not committing at the moment, although she did meet up with Simon Cowell this week,\" a source told the newspaper.  Fellow judge Louis Walsh confirmed Nicole, who infuriated Andrew Lloyd Webber by pulling out of a Broadway show to join the judging panel last year (16), is the only judge not to have agreed a new deal.  \"I hope everyone is on board this year, but I have heard Nicole has not signed. She might be getting a big movie like Wicked,\" Louis said, while revealing he, Sharon Osbourne and Simon Cowell were all returning to the ITV show.  However, if the 38-year-old singer does not return, Louis hinted they may enlist the help of Mel B, who previously judged on the show in 2014.  \"Mel B\u2019s done it before, so would be good, and she\u2019s currently on the US (America\\'s Got Talent) show with Simon,\" Louis added.

But it\\'s the caption that has the Internet speculating:\\xa0\"Taylor swift what up,\" Bieber wrote.  Watch Belieber Kanye West Dance to Justin Bieber\\'s \\'What Do You Mean?\\' at L.A. Show  So many layers. The photo, which also features their manager, Scooter Braun,\\xa0is further proof that one-time \"Runaway Love\"\\xa0collaborators Bieber and West are still pals. But\\xa0it also brought to mind the terse, meme-y \"what\\'s good?\"\\xa0exchange between Nicki Minaj and Miley Cyrus\\xa0at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards. It also posted just three months after Bieber shared an Insta of himself singing Swift\\'s \"Teardrops on My Guitar.\" And not for nothing, the caption to that one was \"TAYLOR SWIFT WHAT UP, HUH.\"  Kanye\\xa0vs. Taylor: Industry Insiders Weight in on the Controversy\\'s Impact on Their Careers  The pic from Bieber comes amid the ongoing feud between West and Swift, which has included a number of back-and-forth allegations regarding his song \"Famous.\" ',\n 'Justin Bieber\\'s \\'Purpose\\' show at Barclays Center lacks focus  Justin Bieber may need to work a little harder on his focus.  Sure, keeping it together on a massive outing like his \"Purpose\" tour night after night is tough. So it\\'s understandable that his mic was at his side Wednesday night when he was supposed to be singing, making it clear that he was lip syncing for at least part of the show.  And there were points when he was standing still while his phalanx of 12 dancers were around him.  But Bieber forgot to sing his most recent No. 1 single \"Love Yourself\" in the middle of his show.  \"I got a little ahead of myself,\" Bieber said, as the stagehands rushed to return the sofa they had already removed as well as tuning his acoustic guitar again. \"Should I skip it?\"  Of course, the capacity crowd screamed \"No!\" And, to his credit, Bieber, a little red-faced, delivered a strong version of the song.  Though Bieber pulled his career out of a tailspin with the recent string of three No. 1 hits from his album \"Purpose,\" his concert at Barclays Center Wednesday night showed that his career rebound hasn\\'t solved all his problems. (Bieber returns to Barclays Center again Thursday, much to the chagrin of New York Islanders fans whose playoff game is delayed until Friday to accommodate the show.)  The \"Purpose\" tour is quite the spectacle, with its multilevel stage and elaborately choreographed routines. But Bieber ends up being the center of attention and, at times, the weakest link.  He opens the show in a massive glass box, and in one of the night\\'s best moments, dances in a circular video screen that looks like he\\'s trapped in a cage. No need for college-level performance art classes to figure out what that means.  The show has its moments. With the upbeat \"Get Used to It\" seeming primed to be his next chart-topper. Bieber looks energized when he\\'s doing flips on a giant trampoline during \"Company.\" And the tropical-tinged dance numbers like \"What Do You Mean?\" and \"Where Are You Now?\" hold up well, giving his faithful fan base plenty to scream about. They want him to succeed and most everyone loves a comeback.  But before that becomes a secure possibility, Bieber needs to find his \"Purpose\" a little more interesting.

Pitt is accused of being \"verbally abusive\" and getting \"physical\" with one of his children on the family\\'s private plane last Wednesday, a source previously told PEOPLE.  The L.A. County Department of Children and Family Services is investigating the 52-year-old after the alleged incident was reported to them anonymously. The case has also been referred to the FBI under special aircraft jurisdiction due to the incident being mid-flight.  \"The FBI is continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued,\" the FBI said in a statement.  Now the source with knowledge of the incident is speaking exclusively to PEOPLE about Pitt\\'s side of the story.  Pitt \"was drunk, and there was an argument between him and Angelina,\" says the source. \"There was a parent-child argument which was not handled in the right way and escalated more than it should have.\"  The source says Pitt did not hurt his son. \"He is emphatic that it did not reach the level of physical abuse, that no one was physically harmed. He did not hit his child in the face in any way. He did not do that; he is emphatic about that. He put his hands on him, yes, because the confrontation was spiraling out of control.\"  \"Brad made contact with Maddox in the shoulder area, and there was absolutely no physical injury to him.\"  A source close to Pitt says any accusations beyond that are \"a combination of exaggerations and lies. They have taken the overall smallest kernel of truth \u2013 that a fight got out of hand and reached a regrettable peak, and that as a result DCFS is looking into it \u2013 and they are manipulating it to best suit their attempts to gain custody.\" ',\n \"Julia Roberts Cuddles Up to Danny Moder Ahead of Their 15th Wedding Anniversary  Julia Roberts and husband Danny Moder were spotted on a casual outing in Malibu, CA, on Saturday afternoon. The couple, who is going on 15 years of marriage in July, put on a loving display as they wrapped their arms around each other and Julia appeared to whisper something in Danny's ear. While we haven't seen the couple out and about together since November, Julia made history in April when she was named People's Most Beautiful Woman for the fifth time. It was also revealed earlier this week that Julia will be returning to the big screen in Crystal City Entertainment's adaptation of The Bookseller.

Following a showing of Hacksaw Ridge a few Saturdays ago, I found myself washing my hands next to two gentlemen \u2014 both appeared to be about 63, the average age of Academy members, with one wearing a Kung Fu Panda 2 cap (the kind of hat a grown man doesn\\'t wear unless he worked on the movie) discussing what they had just seen. \"Didn\\'t want to like that one but ... ,\" the first man said, trailing off. \"But Mel can direct,\" the friend finished.  I knew instantly why they were conflicted. This season, admiration for Hacksaw Ridge as an emotional and deftly staged World War II action drama has come despite the fact that its filmmaker has made anti-Semitic and misogynistic comments. Hacksaw is one of several films in the awards race featuring marquee talent with personal issues in their pasts, highlighting the age-old concern of whether voters should judge the man (and yes, they\\'re all men in this situation), his work or a combination of both?  Like my two restroom pals, awards voters so far this season have been embracing Gibson. Hacksaw Ridge has landed on the AFI top 10 list and earned seven Critics\\' Choice and three Golden Globe noms, including best picture (drama) and best director for Gibson. It\\'s a pretty remarkable turn for a filmmaker who, just six years ago, was fired by his own agents.  At the same time, awards bodies (aside from the NAACP, which nominated it for six Image Awards) and critics groups have ignored The Birth of a Nation, a film that just 11 months ago was lauded by many tastemakers as a sure-fire best picture nominee and the antidote to #OscarsSoWhite. But that was before the details of filmmaker-star Nate Parker\\'s college rape trial resurfaced this summer, along with the news that his accuser had committed suicide. So low have Birth\\'s awards prospects sunk that the film didn\\'t even appear on lists of Globe or SAG Award snubs. And Fox Searchlight, which typically hosts a \"holiday party\" to allow its talent to mingle with voters, turned this season\\'s soiree into a celebration of Jackie, its other contender, ignoring Birth.  Why do some personal troubles stick to movies while others seem to not bother voters? That question has arisen throughout Oscar history. Russell Crowe\\'s assault of a BAFTA producer is said to have cost him an Oscar for 2001\\'s A Beautiful Mind, but in 2003, Roman Polanski won best director for The Pianist even though he couldn\\'t accept his award in person because he is a fugitive from justice after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a minor, then 13, in 1977.  This year, these issues haven\\'t only swirled around Gibson, Parker and, to a lesser extent, Woody Allen, whose latest film, Cafe Society, arrived at Cannes amid renewed allegations by his son Ronan Farrow that Allen had sexually abused Ronan\\'s sister Dylan. Some have questioned why Casey Affleck, a best actor frontrunner for his powerful performance in Manchester by the Sea, has not been subject to Nate Parker-style scrutiny for the two sexual harassment lawsuits filed against him in 2010 by a female producer and a director of photography who claimed Affleck tormented them during the making of the bizarre mockumentary I\\'m Still Here. DP Magdalena Gorka\\'s suit claimed she was made to suffer \"a nearly daily barrage of sexual comments, innuendo and unwelcome advances by crewmembers, within the presence and with the active encouragement of Affleck.\" Affleck denied the allegations and settled the suits for a reported $2 million. So far, he\\'s picked up a Gotham Award and a Critics\\' Choice win.  Some have insinuated that Parker\\'s race played a role in his banishment, either consciously or subconsciously. And they may be right. Another factor might be the especially shocking nature of the claims against him, despite his acquittal, or his refusal in media interviews to apologize, or the fact that sexual assault is dramatized in his film. But it might also be the clubby nature of Hollywood that forgives those perceived as insiders and gives no benefit of the doubt to those who aren\\'t. Affleck, a Hollywood presence for almost as long as his brother Ben, is an insider. Gibson, movie star and best picture winner for Braveheart, is another insider. He was sent to directors jail for a decade before reemerging this year, and voters seem to be saying enough time has passed. Also, his movie is really good.  This time of year, it\\'s all about getting voters to actually see the contenders. And while one Oscar-nominated producer recently told me he felt an \"ickiness\" when deciding to pop in his Hacksaw screener, he did it anyway and liked the film. This same producer didn\\'t think twice about watching Manchester. But, like many, he hasn\\'t even bothered to open his Birth of a Nation screener.

A slight twinge in the universe, quick and subtle, but a definite sign that something in the world just shifted. Ah, here\u2019s what it is\u2014Kanye West just deleted his Twitter and Instagram accounts.  The rapper apparently decided to abolish his social-media presence on Friday, waving good-bye to all those followers and likes and faves. Those tweets about Wiz Khalifa\u2019s cool pants? Gone. That \u201c###hashtag all positive vibes\u201d tweet? Gone. Those \u201cI\u2019M SO LUCKY\u201d tweets accompanied by nearly nude shots of his wife, Kim Kardashian West? Banished to the nothingness hinterlands of deleted posts. So too are all those random Insta photos of old Margiela lookbooks. For what it\u2019s worth, West was never much of an Instagram power user anyway, deferring to his wife on that social platform (though he occasionally made strong post recommendations). His Twitter account, however, was practically an extended part of his brain, a home for stream-of-consciousness thoughts that caused as much controversy as they did delight. So why did he delete it? And what does it all mean right now?  Well, this isn\u2019t the first time West has waved good-bye to his social-media platforms. Sometimes, it\u2019s because the artist wants to garner a little bit of buzz for upcoming projects. Back in 2013, West deleted all of his tweets, leaving only one cryptic message up: \u201cJune Eighteen.\u201d That ended up being the release date for his upcoming album Yeezus, which was famously inspired by a Corbusier lamp and was released without an album cover or promotional singles.  So what could it be this time around? West ended 2016 on a rough personal note, hospitalized for exhaustion and sleep deprivation. He later kicked up controversy by meeting with Donald Trump at Trump Tower shortly after his election, tweeting about it, and then deleting those tweets. West, as all his fans know, has serious political aspirations, announcing his presidential dreams at, of all West-ian locations, the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards.  Nevertheless, West has been maintaining a low profile as of late and is probably putting his political dreams on the back burner for the moment. It\u2019s more likely that he\u2019s deleting his social accounts (1) to get attention, and/or (2) for an upcoming artistic project. The workaholic is constantly working on new music and new fashion for his Yeezy Season line and Adidas collection. On Friday, he and Kardashian West launched TheKidsSupply, a high-priced children\u2019s clothing collection. He recently released a high-end collection of religious-inspired gold jewelry. \u201cI wanted to create something that represented timeless love,\u201d he recently told Vogue.  The only thing missing from his endless release cycle is . . . new music. Last year, shortly after releasing The Life of Pablo (a release cycle marked by controversial tweets), __West tweeted about a cryptic new music project titled Turbo Grafx 16, after the old gaming console. However, that project seems to have fallen to the wayside, as there have been new rumblings of a NASA-inspired project, though it was later debunked by fans. Still, it\u2019s impossible to believe he\u2019s not working on something new.  But maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014West is . . . merely enjoying being an incredibly rich celebrity? Taking a much-needed break from the public eye? The fashion-obsessed star recently skipped the Met Gala, an event he\u2019s frequented numerous times over the year as the chief ambassador of #vibes and shredded jeans. Why did he skip it? He just wanted to stay home, according to his wife.  \u201cHe\u2019s been taking some time off and really loving that,\u201d she told Andr\u00e9 Leon Talley on the red carpet.  O.K., we\u2019ll consider that story . . . for now. But don\u2019t expect West to stay off social media for too long. ',\n 'Kim, Kourtney & Khloe Kardashian Celebrate Cinco de Mayo in LA!

After experiencing pregnancy complications with her two children, Kardashian West has been vocal about her willingness to conceive via surrogate. \"After talking to Kanye, I think I always knew that surrogacy was an option, but I didn\\'t think it was that realistic of an option, and now I feel like that\\'s my reality,\" she said on the show in an episode that aired in April. \"I feel like surrogacy really is the only other option for me.\" Sister Kylie Jenner is pregnant and due in February, two sources close to the family told CNN last week. Days after that news, there were reports Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian may be also pregnant. CNN has reached out to reps for Khlo\u00e9 for confirmation.

Her bestfriend Jennifer Aniston is supportive of her but their relationship is sometimes targeted by rumor mongers.   Selena Gomez and Jennifer Aniston were reported to have planned for a double date with their respective partners after The Weeknd\\'s tour wraps up. The \"Hands to Myself\" singer was also reported telling that her BFF has given her advices\\xa0on her new relationship. But fans of Justin Bieber\\'s ex-girlfriend should not rejoice over the reports because they were declared as all lies.  According to Gossip Cop,\\xa0the above-mentioned reports were found out to be all false and the source of the news was merely fabricating stories. The site which is out to expose hearsays and false reports about celebrities has verified the said reports.  The news that was published by Hollywood Life\\xa0dated March 23 states that the \"Mother\\'s Day\" star was excited for her little sister\\'s new beau and she was grateful that she has found peace in life. She was reportedly proud of her and of what she has become. They were already talking about the planned double date as alleged by the report. Gomez was reportedly spending time with her boyfriend\\'s family.  In another report from the same source dated January 17, 2017, it states that the \"Horrible Bosses\" actor has told the \"Kill Em With Kindness\" singer to follow her heart and that the Justin Theroux\\'s wife was giving love advices to Selena Gomez.  Well, with the reports on Aniston\\'s reactions about her friend\\'s love life being debunked, the only reliable source would be people close to Gomez and since they have not publicized anything, it is best to take everything with a grain of salt. Regarding the double date, the probability that it will happen is nil at the moment but who knows, it might happen in the future.  The Weeknd and the 24-year-old former Disney star\\'s relationship became controversial after it was revealed months back. The rapper has just moved on from a relationship with Bella Hadid and the model even warned her ex-boyfriend about Gomez. She said that the \"Same Old Love\" singer was only using him for her career.  Selena Gomez declared that she is determined to make their relationship work and denied all the negative comments about her. The singer, who has successfully dealt with her emotional issues due to her Lupus, is now happy supporting her boyfriend. She was seen at the rapper\\'s concert in Brazil recently. ',\n 'Sorry, Paris Hilton Never Actually Ordered Kim K Around On \\'The Simple Life\\'  The Internet loves to remind itself of Kim Kardashian\\'s relatively humble beginnings. That is, before she became the world\\'s most famous reality star, she spent her days toiling as an assistant to then-BFF Paris Hilton.  What\\'s more, the Internet loves to relive a few moments of Hilton being particularly unkind to Kardashian as she allegedly orders her around. Those moments were forever captured on camera for episodes of \"The Simple Life\" back in the mid-2000s.  Screengrabs from these episodes have become very popular, but there\\'s just one problem -- the captions are completely fake and your favorite Kim Kardashian meme is a fraud.  Here\\'s the conversation that actually took place on the episode:  Yep, that was a scene about giving a dog a pregnancy test.  But moving on, this gif with a caption of Hilton telling Kardashian to organize her closet is again also 100 percent fake.  And while it may be fake, it may actually be better than the real conversation that was had in Paris\\' closet that day:  Paris: I love this closet, it\\'s so good.    Kim: What\\'s going on with this?   Paris: That\\'s my \\'If I ever go to India\\' outfit.   Kim: Really?   Paris: Yes.   Kim: Are you planning on going?   Paris: Yes, but don\\'t you have to, like, cover up everything?   Kim: You\\'re not allowed to show any of your hair. It\\'s like a law.    Paris: Are you allowed to have blond hair? If you travel there do you really have to do this?   Kim: I think so, or you\\'ll get like shot or something.    Paris: That\\'s hot.  It\\'s difficult to pinpoint exactly where these screengrabs with fake captions originated, but multiple news outlets just assumed they were real, and the myth of Hilton as a demanding boss who desperately needed her closet organized only continued to grow. However, after learning what Hilton and Kardashian were really discussing at the time, the two might now be wishing the hotel heiress was actually ordering the future reality star to clean her closet.  So, if you want these memes to live on, use the right captions: ',\n \"Kendall Jenner Has Another 22nd Birthday Bash With Blake Griffin, Kim Kardashian, and More: Pics!

There, they had the chance to get eyes on \u201cSalvator Mundi,\u201d a Leonardo da Vinci painting previously thought lost that is being touted as \u201c The Last da Vinci \u201d leading up to its auction tonight.  \u201cThe Last da Vinci,\u201d which dates to 1500 and is estimated to sell for around $100 million, is also the title of the new Christie\u2019s video promoting the piece\u2019s auction, an event that\\'s getting the marketing treatment of a summer blockbuster movie. Supposedly shot from the perspective of Jesus (that is, from the perspective of the painting, which depicts Jesus as \u201cSavior of the World\u201d), it depicts various viewers gathered in front of the painting, many of them glassy-eyed with emotion. And, Where\u2019s Waldo -like, a keen-eyed observer might also spot Smith and DiCaprio, fresh off his 43rd birthday, among the video\u2019s subjects, albeit looking significantly less on the verge of tears than many of the other viewers.  After all, DiCaprio might just be there to get a few insights, Daniel Day-Lewis-style, into his next character: The Oscar-winner and climate justice enthusiast is slated to play Leonardo da Vinci in an upcoming biopic based on Leonardo da Vinci , the biography by Walter Isaacson. Paramount scooped up the rights to the film back in August, with DiCaprio slated to star in, and co-produce, the film, which will require him to grow his Revenant beard to unprecedented lengths.  Bringing things full circle, \u201cThe Last da Vinci\u201d is scored by the Max Richter piece \u201cOn the Nature of Daylight,\u201d a movie-soundtrack staple that was recently used in the opening scene of Arrival and, before that, in Shutter Island , which, yes, starred DiCaprio, and was directed by Martin Scorsese, from whom DiCaprio is now practically inseparable . It\u2019s probably only a matter of time before Scorsese signs on to DiCaprio\u2019s da Vinci biopic. After all, they\u2019re also working on a Teddy Roosevelt biopic together.

For starters, the rapper didn\u2019t even attend the tennis star\u2019s nuptials. Gossip Cop can set the record straight. Williams got married to internet entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian in front of friends and family in New Orleans on Thursday. The guest list included many celebrities, including Beyonce, Kim Kardashian, Kelly Rowland, Anna Wintour, Ciara and Eva Longoria. Minaj wasn\u2019t in attendance, but the Irish website Her posted a doctored Instagram photo that shows her posing at the party with Beyonce and Rihanna. The site titled its inaccurate article, \u201cWhat Nicki Minaj wore to Serena Williams\u2019 wedding is not really OK,\u201d and says the singer showed up to the ceremony sporting \u201cwhite leather hotpants and a crop top.\u201d The misinformed outlet insists Minaj\u2019s outfit was \u201ckinda too much,\u201d further maintaining that she \u201cvery much overstepped a wedding etiquette line.\u201d But the site\u2019s opinion about the rapper\u2019s attire is completely moot. Neither Minaj or Rihanna were at the tennis player\u2019s wedding. Both music stars were superimposed into a photo of Beyonce posing alone at the ceremony. It\u2019s unclear if the Irish outlet is trying to trick its readers or get duped by the fake image itself, but Minaj didn\u2019t wear an inappropriate outfit to Williams\u2019 wedding, which she didn\u2019t attend. It should be noted, Gossip Cop has had to debunk several false stories surrounding the tennis star\u2019s nuptials in the short time since she walked down the aisle. We recently busted HollywoodLife for fabricating a report about Beyonce and Kardashian having an \u201cicy exchange\u201d at the wedding. Gossip Cop also called out RadarOnline for making up a story about Kardashian getting yelled at for using her phone at Williams\u2019 wedding.

In an interview with People magazine, Mrs. Obama, who promotes healthy lifestyles, said it\u2019s possible she would consider plastic surgery or Botox at some point. \u201cWomen should have the freedom to do whatever they need to do to feel good about themselves,\u201d Mrs. Obama said. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t imagine that I would go that route, but I\u2019ve also learned to never say never.\u201d The first lady said she never misses a regular checkup with her doctor, and that she\u2019s already had a colonoscopy, recommended for people generally at age 50 and beyond. \u201cI don\u2019t obsess about what I eat, but I do make sure that I\u2019m eating vegetables and fruit,\u201d Mrs. Obama told the magazine. \u201cAnd as everyone knows, I do exercise.\u201d ',\n 'Kim And Kanye Silence Divorce Rumors With Family Photo  Kanye took to Twitter on Tuesday to share a photo of his family, simply writing, \"Happy Holidays.\" In the picture, seemingly taken at Kris Jenner\\'s annual Christmas Eve party, Kim and a newly blond Kanye pose with their children, North, 3, and Saint, 1.

',\n \"AMAL CLOONEY IS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL WOMAN IN LONDON  You'd be forgiven for thinking the most powerful woman in London might be the Duchess of Cambridge, or even supermodel Kate Moss. In fact, it's George Clooney's new bride who has taken out the top spot.  Amal Clooney was named #4 in\\xa0the Evening Standard's The 1000 Power List 2014 following British Prime Minister David Cameron, scientist Steven Hawkins and Prince Harry. \\xa0Other women crowned in the Top 20 were designer and UN Goodwill ambassador Victoria Beckham at #9, recent Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai at #12 and legendary performer Kate Bush at #16.  So what is it about Clooney that makes her so influential? She has recently become better known as the well dressed, beautiful 36 year old wife of Hollywood star George Clooney, but Amal has been making waves as a top Barrister\\xa0specialising in international law for years and describes herself as 'lawyer, activist and author.'  The British Lebanese lawyer perhaps most famously defended Julian Assange, the founder of Wiki Leaks, in his fight against extradition in Sweden earlier this year. She also represented Yulia Tymoshenko, the former prime minister of Ukraine\\xa0before the European Court of Human Rights while the latter was detained under the rule of ousted Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. Her credentials don't stop there, with Clooney having previously worked across numerous United Nations commissions, advising governments across international law.  Furthermore, in May 2014 she met with British Foreign Secretary William Hague to discuss international efforts to respond to sexual violence in conflict zones.  So sought after is Clooney, that she recently had to turn down an offer from the United Nations to be one of three people on an inquiry investigating war crimes in Gaza; stating that 'I am honoured... but given existing commitments - including eight ongoing cases - unfortunately I could not accept this role.'  So how did Clooney become such an internationally renowned lawyer? She studied Jurisprudence at St. Hugh's College, Oxford where she received an Exhibition scholarship and the Shrigley award, followed by a Master of Law degree at the prestigious New York University where she gained the Jack J. Katz Memorial Award for excellence in entertainment law. Since then she has lectured students on international criminal Law in London, New York and North Carolina.  Having recently returned home to London from a trip to Athens advising the Greek government, it seems Amal Clooney has taken the world, not just London, by storm, and rightly so. \",\n \"Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs Take Cannes in His-and-Hers Dior  Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs rarely adhere to traditional rules of style, and when it was time for the pair to hit Cannes , they gave the red carpet a daring couples' moment. Wearing his-and-hers Dior at the premiere of Pattinson\u2019s latest film, Good Time , they showed two sides of the storied French brand, with Pattinson, a face of the label, going classic in a dapper three-piece Dior Homme black suit and Twigs opting for audacity in a postcard print-covered dress.  Twigs\u2019s colorful choice was actually plucked from the archives: John Galliano\u2019s Spring 2002 \u201cstreet chic\u201d collection. The rebellious spirit of that season has experienced a revival of late, with fashion insiders unearthing their J\u2019Adore Dior T-shirts and logo-covered bikinis. For her retro moment, Twigs skipped the layered runway styling and paired the gown with a simple ribbon choker and marabou-covered heels for a dainty contrast to Pattinson\u2019s movie-star suiting. Separately, each would have been well dressed, but together they proved the versatility and enduring cool of one of fashion\u2019s best-loved houses. \",\n 'Kylie Jenner Sets the Record Straight About Reports Tyga Owes Her $2 Million  Defending her ex. Kylie Jenner took to Twitter on Friday, May 27, to address reports that her ex-boyfriend Tyga owes her $2 million.  \"Lies lies lies,\" the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 18, wrote in response to a tweet.    The reports appear to stem from a story on Radar Online on Thursday, May 26, that claimed Jenner had been \"bankrolling Tyga for well over a year and she\\'s finding herself short on cash as a result.\"    The \"Rack City\" rapper, 26, gave Jenner lavish presents during their relationship, even presenting her with a $320,000 Ferrari for her 18th birthday.    The lipstick queen and Blac Chyna\\'s ex-fianc\u00e9\\xa0split in early May and Jenner has already moved on with rapper PartyNextDoor.  As Us Weekly previously reported, the Canadian rapper, 22, actually began courting Kylie two months ago, but the pair kept things platonic because she was still dating Tyga.  PHOTOS: See All of Kylie Jenner\\'s Most Colorful Hairstyles Things have quickly heated up since they were first spotted out together on May 18. On Saturday, May 28, the \"Come and See Me\" singer crooned about his new love as he sat at a piano in a Snapchat video Jenner posted.  The feeling appears to be mutual - the teen was photographed with her arm around PND when the pair went on a bowling date earlier this week. ',\n 'Tom Cruise awkwardly swerves question about daughter Suri  Tom Cruise politely responded to a question about daughter Suri at his Mummy premiere last night, but didn\\'t appear comfortable enough talking about her to elaborate on the answer.  The 54-year-old actor was asked whether he thought 11-year-old Suri might have the acting gene just like him and mum Katie Holmes.  \"You never know, you never know,\" he replied awkwardly to The Sydney Herald..    He then turned the subject back onto himself, before continuing: \"For me, I just love making movies. I have been doing it my whole life. I am shooting Mission Impossible right now.  \"I just left from France to be here today and while I was doing it, I was in post production on another film, one I have coming out in August called American Made and I am also prepping two other films, it\\'s just what I do.\"  While the Mission Impossible star prefers to keep his family life private, which is fair enough, there were reports last year that he hadn\\'t seen Suri for three years.  Katie and Tom divorced in June 2012, with US Weekly claiming that the last time he saw Suri was when they were pictured at Disney\\'s Typhoon Lagoon Water Park in Florida three years ago.  They commented: \"Tom hasn\\'t seen or even called Suri in about three years. Tom has no relationship with Suri. Tom has no relationship with Suri.\"    However, neither Tom nor Katie responded to the speculation.  Katie is Suri\\'s primary carer, with the 38-year-old Dawson\\'s Creek star recently sharing pictures from her daughter\\'s birthday on Instagram.  She also posted a throwback photo of Suri and added the caption: \"My light\". ',\n \"Hats off to love! Jennifer Lawrence, 26, and Darren Aronofsky, 47, go public with their romance as they bundle up for stroll in NYC  They had been keeping their budding romance under wraps but it seems that Jennifer Lawrence and Darren Aronofsky have made a New Year's resolution to be more open about their relationship.  The May-December couple were spotted out together in New York City again on Monday, just a couple of days after they were seen taking Jennifer's beloved pup Pippi to a dog park in Manhattan.  The actress, 26, and the director, 47, strolled along side-by-side with Aronofsky at one point holding onto his girlfriend's arm as they walked.  The two met when Aronofsky, who shares a 10-year-old son Henry, with former fiancee Rachel Weisz, cast Lawrence in a leading role for his film Mother, due out later this year.  Filming finished in August last year and rumors about their romance started swirling in October when they were photographed together.  They confirmed their relationship after they were photographed kissing on a public street in New York.  While the filmmaker appeared up beat and beamed broadly as he spent time with his main squeeze, the actress appeared a little more reticent about showing her feelings in public, walking with her head tilted down and wearing sunglasses,  The Hunger Games star was stylish in a pair of distressed jeans paired with a black Peacoat with white sheepskin collar and trim.  She wore her blonde hair tied back into a ponytail under a jaunty peaked cap and added shiny black bovver boots.  Aronofsky, meanwhile, opted for his default outfit of puffy black jacket zipped up tight to his neck and blue jeans with brown lace-up shoes.  He added a blue knitted hat pulled down over his ears.  Lawrence gushed about her new beau in a recent interview with Vanity Fair, describing the Black Swan director as 'a visionary.'  She revealed she'd long been a fan of his work and didn't hesitate to sign up to star in his new movie even though there was no script for it at the time. \",\n 'Vanessa Paradis Talks Split With Johnny Depp  Break-ups are hard to handle, and no one knows that better than Vanessa Paradis  The stunning French actress and longtime love of\\xa0Johnny Depp officially announced their separation in June, after two kids (Lily-Rose, 13, and Jack, 10) and 14-years together.

There\u2019s the Angelina Jolie who\u2019s now a single mother\u2014managing the day-to-day chaos of six kids, and the trauma of her split from Brad Pitt\u2014and there\u2019s the Angelina Jolie whose latest movie, a groundbreaking Netflix original about Cambodia\u2019s genocide, is also a thank-you to the nation that transformed her. At her new L.A. mansion, Jolie reveals the tension between the two Angelinas and the reason her life will never be normal.  Like most things involving Angelina Jolie, stepping foot into her house is an experience so heightened one wonders if it\u2019s for real or the product of careful orchestration. The large gates to her recently purchased Los Feliz house\u2014an 11,000-square-foot Beaux-Arts mansion once owned by the epic filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille\u2014slowly swing open, revealing rolling lawns, lush trees at the perimeter. No one\u2019s there, and all is quiet except for the delicate sound of fountains, arched in a row over a swimming pool. A number of doors to the house are open, as if posing some riddle from a fairy tale\u2014which one to enter? Inside, the vibe is airy and calm: all open windows and cross-breezes, creamy-white unlit candles, soft creamy-white furnishings. Finally she emerges from the other side of the house and glides across the room in a creamy-white, floor-length caftan. Her hair is down, her feet bare, only a touch of makeup, her skin luminous. She smiles widely\u2014a beneficent, ethereal wood nymph. But as soon as she starts speaking, you realize that your preconceived notions about Jolie aren\u2019t quite right. She\u2019s not a celestial goddess. She\u2019s not the high-and-mighty do-gooder. She\u2019s not the intense control freak\u2014or at least not obviously so. She comes across, rather, as normal-person friendly and practical, even chitchatty. She explains the deal with the big empty mansion. She moved into this space just four days ago with her six kids. It wasn\u2019t for the prestigious history or the architecture. She needed a good place fast, somewhere secluded, with a lot of rooms; this one, which was listed for around $25 million, has six bedrooms and 10 bathrooms. Following her September 2016 filing for divorce from Brad Pitt, she and her children spent nine months in a rental, basically living out of suitcases. And so she hasn\u2019t really unpacked, barely knows her way around the place, has never had a real visitor, and isn\u2019t sure where the best spot is to sit and talk. With that in question, she roams from room to room\u2014the fabulous kitchen, worthy of a Nancy Meyers movie, charming gray library with a library ladder (her favorite room in the house), the generous landing at the foot of a sweeping staircase, anchored by a round table with a bouquet of white flowers. She finally settles on the living room, which a set-decorator friend furnished on the fly, with two creamy-white sofas and some big throw pillows. She looks at them curiously. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know I needed \u2018throw pillows.\u2019\\u2009\u201d Decorating, house stuff, \u201cthat was always Brad\u2019s thing.\u201d On cue, as if taunting her, Jolie\u2019s large Rottweiler, Dusty, soaking from a trip to the pool, jumps onto the sofa, soiling it. She sighs, amused, half tries to wipe it off with her bare hand, then gives up and sits somewhere else. Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Life in her household is apparently like this\u2014messy, relaxed, normal. The kids are polite but not phony polite. Zahara, 12, whom Jolie describes as \u201cthe rock\u201d of the family, comes downstairs. \u201cZaz!\u201d Jolie cries, midsentence. They discuss the whereabouts of everyone else. Zahara hugs the wet dog. Jolie laughs and tells her daughter about the swim Dusty just took. We move to the kitchen, where Jolie fixes herself a cup of tea. Vivienne, 9, comes in with a friend, having just been at a sleepover. She\u2019s wearing a jean backpack covered with pins. Jolie envelops her in her arms. I ask the girl if she\u2019s called \u201cViv\u201d or \u201cVivienne.\u201d \u201cEither one!\u201d she says with a smile. She dumps her stuff on the counter and goes out to play with her friend. Jolie picks up a small piece of a blanket, shredded to death, and explains, laughing, \u201cShe has 32 blankets. She is very into her blanket, and she gets very mad if you wash her blanket. She actually said to me the other day, \u2018Mom, I can taste my blanket.\u2019 \u2018That, honey, is a sign that it really, really needs to be washed.\u2019\\u2009\u201d Jolie tidies up Vivienne\u2019s things and promptly spills her entire mug of tea all over the counter. We step outside and there\u2019s Shiloh, 11, and Knox, 9, hanging out. Shiloh, who likes to dress like a boy, is wearing a camouflage jacket, long shorts, and heavy black sneakers, despite the blazing heat. Knox immediately wants to know when Jolie\u2019s going to put up the waterslide. \u201cHow about a \u2018Hello, Mom\u2019?\u201d she says, with a hug, sounding like just about every other loving, exasperated mother in America. So far, there\u2019s only one piece of personal artwork up\u2014a black-and-white photograph on the mantelpiece of the six children, smiling and holding their various pets\u2014dogs, reptiles, and rodents.  Jolie and Pitt, who\u2019d been together for 12 years and appeared to be the most gloriously evolved couple in Hollywood, split last September. She filed for divorce suddenly \u201cfor the health of the family,\u201d according to her lawyer, and announced she was seeking sole custody of the children, three of whom are adopted (Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, and Zahara), three of whom are biological (Shiloh, Vivienne, and Knox). Things had been rocky for some time, but the last straw was a dramatic trip on a private plane, where there was reportedly a physical and verbal altercation between Pitt and Maddox. When they touched down, Jolie went home with the kids, effectively kicking him out. This was no \u201cConscious Uncoupling.\u201d An anonymous phone call was made to authorities. The F.B.I. and the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services began investigating Pitt for child abuse. He was soon cleared and later said in an interview with GQ Style that he was smarting from the pain of his suddenly broken family and admitted he had a serious drinking problem. There were rumors he was having an affair with Marion Cotillard (denied by both Pitt and Cotillard). Jolie got the early jump P.R.-wise. But Pitt won hearts and minds with the mea culpa in GQ Style. The two are still negotiating the terms of their divorce. As for Jolie, a life already bursting at the seams\u2014with acting, directing, humanitarian work, parenting six kids, and guest-lecturing on women\u2019s rights at the London School of Economics\u2014just got exponentially bigger and more complicated, because she\u2019s now doing it alone. There\u2019s the chaos surrounding the practical day-to-day\u2014playdates, doctors\u2019 appointments, packing and unpacking, and organizing mealtimes. And there\u2019s the deeper, emotional chaos. \u201cIt\u2019s just been the hardest time, and we\u2019re just kind of coming up for air. [This house] is a big jump forward for us, and we\u2019re all trying to do our best to heal our family.\u201d As it happens, the personal trauma has coincided with her most personal film yet. Jolie has directed a moving, large-scale adaptation of First They Killed My Father, Loung Ung\u2019s 2000 memoir of the Khmer Rouge genocide, in which Ung\u2019s parents and two of her siblings perished, along with an estimated two million other Cambodians, a quarter of the country\u2019s population. Shot entirely in Cambodia, and in the Khmer language, the film, a Netflix original, is the largest production the country has witnessed since the war, and according to the reports of several Cambodians who\u2019ve seen it, it\u2019s one of the most revelatory pieces of art about that chapter in the country\u2019s history, a history that\u2019s still difficult for Cambodians to discuss. But if Cambodians consider the film to be something of a gift, then it\u2019s surely a thank-you gift. For Jolie, Cambodia is where she started her family, and it\u2019s where she made a cathartic personal transformation, becoming the woman she is today.  Recall, if you can, the Angelina of the late 90s, the era of Angie Peak Crazy. Specializing in dark volatile characters that seemed extensions of her wild-child restless self, Jolie won three Golden Globes for her roles in television movies and a best- supporting-actress Oscar for her portrayal of a young woman with apparent borderline personality disorder in Girl, Interrupted. She talked freely about having dabbled in heroin and self-cutting, and her love of knives. She and new husband Billy Bob Thornton wore each other\u2019s dried blood in pendants around their necks, and publicly bragged about their wild sex. At the 2000 Oscar ceremony, she talked provocatively about being \u201cso in love . . . right now\u201d with her brother, James, and kissed him with unsettling intimacy. To be sure, Jolie had legitimate pain in her early life\u2014her father, actor Jon Voight, had been unfaithful to her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, and the two split up early on. But it was First World pain. Being Hollywood\u2019s newest \u201cIt girl\u201d landed Jolie the title role in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, based on a popular video game. As it happened, the movie, an example of Hollywood\u2019s most vacuous, commercial, shoot-\u2019em-up instincts, was filmed on location in Cambodia. There, Jolie, who\u2019d grown up in privileged bubbles in Los Angeles and New York, witnessed what real suffering looked like: poverty, the loss of limbs from land mines, a generation of relatives wiped out. In this world there was no room for free-floating malaise or self-indulgent antics. And in spite of their profound trials, \u201cI found a people who were so kind and warm and open, and, yes, very complex,\u201d recalls Jolie. \u201cYou drive around here you can see a lot of people with many things, but not often expressing happiness. You go there, and you see the families come out with their blanket and their picnic to watch a sunset.\u201d Photographs by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. She suddenly became curious about the world\u2014starting with the country she was in. One day in Siem Reap, Cambodia, she picked up a book that was being sold on the side of the road for $2: Ung\u2019s memoir. It was among the factors that inspired Jolie to find a greater purpose. In 2001, equipping herself with as much knowledge as she could, she contacted the United Nations and eventually became a goodwill ambassador for the High Commissioner for Refugees. On one of her first U.N. missions, in 2002, she returned to Cambodia to meet up with NGO workers who were dealing with land-mine issues. Among them was Ung, the author of that transformative book, who had moved to America since the war but had spent her adult years working on Cambodia\u2019s troubles. She had never seen an Angelina Jolie movie, but Jolie certainly didn\u2019t seem like anyone\u2019s vision of a movie star. \u201cShe was just a really cool human being,\u201d recalls Ung. \u201cAnd she didn\u2019t mind getting dirty.\u201d On her relationship with Brad Pitt: \u201cWe care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal.\u201d She and Jolie clicked and made a plan to travel together to a land-mine-filled part of Cambodia where Ung hadn\u2019t been since the war. Thus began a sequence that sounds as though it must have been written for a movie\u2014but it wasn\u2019t. They met up with a bunch of de-miners, took off on mo-peds, with only a flashlight and some extra toilet paper as supplies, when a monsoon started. Soaked, they went to bed in hammocks. Before going to sleep, Jolie realized she already trusted Ung enough to ask her about something personal, something big she\u2019d been thinking about\u2014adopting a Cambodian orphan. \u201cI asked her as a Cambodian orphan if she would be offended for somebody like me, an outsider, [to do that], or if that would be a nice thing,\u201d recalls Jolie. Ung was wholeheartedly supportive. \u201cAngie was maternal to everybody around her, not just children, but adults included. I wanted her to adopt me,\u201d says Ung. \u201cI was orphaned when I was eight years old, and so I think, when you\u2019ve gone through experiences like that, there\u2019s always a part of you that craves to have full parent figures in your life.\u201d Jolie says that Ung\u2019s enthusiasm for the idea of her adopting was a deciding factor. Had she responded differently, explains Jolie, \u201cit might have changed my decision. It might have made it very hard for me.\u201d Ung has been in Jolie\u2019s life ever since and is now one of her few close friends. Jolie immediately set the adoption process in motion. A couple of months later, she visited an orphanage in the provincial town of Battambang, having promised herself that she\u2019d go only to one, that she wasn\u2019t going to shop around. But Jolie felt uneasy as she wandered the rooms, meeting the children. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel a connection with any of them,\u201d she recalls. Photographs by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. \u201cThey then said, \u2018There\u2019s one more baby.\u2019\\u2009\u201d Baby Maddox was lying in a box that was suspended from the ceiling. She looked at him. He looked at her. \u201cI cried and cried,\u201d she recalls.  And thus began a 15-year project, in which Jolie rebranded herself, expanding her world, her family, her career, and her image. She bought a house in Cambodia and became a citizen. In 2003, she started what became the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation, focusing on Cambodia\u2019s environmental conservation, health, education, and infrastructure. She intensified her U.N. work, going on dozens of fact-finding missions, to such global hot spots as Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia, and Haiti. (She\u2019s now been on more than 60 missions.) She split from Thornton, who didn\u2019t understand her newfound passion. She adopted her second child, Zahara, from Ethiopia. In 2004 she met Pitt, on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith, when he was still married to Jennifer Aniston. For Jolie, dating Pitt\u2014Hollywood\u2019s gorgeous, laid-back golden boy\u2014catapulted her to another level of fame. Though she has maintained that they didn\u2019t become romantically involved until he and Aniston had split, the couple wasted no time in exhibiting their romance for the pages of W, which did a 32-page spread of them playing house, with a pretend brood of five. Aniston was devastated. For Pitt, dating Jolie meant doing it her way, at least at the outset. It marked the beginning of his own philanthropic life\u2014in Africa, Haiti, and New Orleans\u2014and he formally adopted Maddox and Zahara. He persuaded Jolie to have biological children. She gave birth to Shiloh in 2006, in Namibia, then the twins, Vivienne and Knox, in 2008. In between they adopted Pax, then three, from Vietnam. They bought more homes\u2014in France, Spain, New York, and New Orleans. While Pitt, as a producer and actor, churned out one prestige movie after another (Moonlight, The Tree of Life, Moneyball, 12 Years a Slave), Jolie took a new chance with directing\u2014with In the Land of Blood and Honey, about Bosnia, a project inspired by some of the U.N. work she\u2019d done there. Together, they appeared unstoppable, the most creatively alive citizens on the planet. Nothing seemed beyond their abilities. They traipsed around the globe as a nomadic clan of eight, making art, doing good, and setting up home wherever they happened to be. They tied the knot in 2014, mainly because the kids wanted them to. They had the means to take along tutors for the children wherever they went. But Jolie\u2019s idea of an education meant immersion in the real world, to bring an understanding of one\u2019s \u201csmall part in the bigger picture.\u201d For a time, it all worked beautifully. Photographs by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl.  It was 2012, and Jolie had recently finished In the Land of Blood and Honey. She wanted her next project to be just as meaningful, and Ung\u2019s story had at this point been with her for a decade. By the time they had a completed draft, the chance for Jolie to direct Unbroken, based on the best-selling book by Laura Hillenbrand, had come along, and they put the script aside. After that, Maddox, who knew \u201cAuntie\u201d Loung\u2019s story, brought it up. \u201cHe was the one who said, \u2018It\u2019s time to do it,\u2019\\u2009\u201d says Jolie. She knew that Maddox would be deeply involved in the production, that he\u2019d be \u201cstanding there watching horrors that his countrymen did to each other. [So] he had to be ready.\u201d Jolie and Ung dived back in. Credited on the film as an executive producer, Maddox read draft after draft, giving comments. Jolie took it to Netflix, where chief creative officer Ted Sarandos signed on without hesitation. \u201cIn the room, she created a visual experience of what this film could be,\u201d recalls Sarandos. \u201cThe film is in many ways about the death of beauty, about the way the Khmer Rouge had killed all things beautiful, color itself, which becomes part of the joy of life. . . . That\u2019s what hooked me more than anything.\u201d Despite Jolie\u2019s Cambodian ties, she felt she needed a Cambodian filmmaker to help shepherd the project. So she reached out to Rithy Panh, one of the most famous filmmakers in Cambodia, who had lost family members to the genocide and had chronicled the Khmer Rouge in several documentaries, including The Missing Picture, which was nominated for the best-foreign-language-film Academy Award in 2014. She and Panh agreed that the only way this film could be made was if Cambodia wanted it to be\u2014not a foregone conclusion, given that Cambodians are still somewhat reticent about their painful history. (The Killing Fields, Roland Joff\u00e9\u2019s 1984 film about the Khmer Rouge, had to be filmed in Thailand and elsewhere.) The war tribunals, which were set in motion in 2009 and are ongoing, have helped open up the topic. Still, Jolie was trepidatious and approached the country\u2019s culture ministers gingerly, explaining that they were telling not just Ung\u2019s story but also the story of a people. Jolie\u2019s Cambodian track record made the difference, says Ung. \u201cIn a country like Cambodia, respect is very much elevated\u2014respect for each other, respect for the culture, respect for the history, respect for the elders. Angie walks in Cambodia with this respect.\u201d Cambodia went all in\u2014closing off Battambang for days, giving the filmmakers permits to land in remote zones, providing them with 500 officials from their actual army to play the Khmer Rouge army. \u201cIt\u2019s not a poetic thing to say\u2014[this film] was made by the country,\u201d says Jolie. Between cast and crew, some 3,500 Cambodians participated.  To cast the children in the film, Jolie looked at orphanages, circuses, and slum schools, specifically seeking children who had experienced hardship. In order to find their lead, to play young Loung Ung, the casting directors set up a game, rather disturbing in its realism: they put money on the table and asked the child to think of something she needed the money for, and then to snatch it away. The director would pretend to catch the child, and the child would have to come up with a lie. \u201cSrey Moch [the girl ultimately chosen for the part] was the only child that stared at the money for a very, very long time,\u201d Jolie says. \u201cWhen she was forced to give it back, she became overwhelmed with emotion. All these different things came flooding back.\u201d Jolie then tears up. \u201cWhen she was asked later what the money was for, she said her grandfather had died, and they didn\u2019t have enough money for a nice funeral.\u201d That authentic connection to pain was awakened in everyone involved, says Jolie, making for a film set like nothing she\u2019d ever seen. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a person who was working on the movie who didn\u2019t have a personal connection. They weren\u2019t coming to do a job. They were walking in the exodus for the people whom they had lost in their family, and it was out of respect for them that they were going to re-create it . . . It completed something for them.\u201d Some had flashbacks and nightmares. For this reason, a therapist was on set every day. And then there were the odd bystanders who hadn\u2019t been aware that a movie was being made, and were traumatized. In one scene, recalls Jolie, \u201cwhen the Khmer Rouge came over the bridge, we had a few people who really dropped to their knees and wailed. They were horrified to see them come back.\u201d Given the size and complexity of the production, a different Hollywood director might have, consciously or not, muscled in and flexed her power in a way that might have seemed boorish. According to Ung and Panh, Jolie knows Cambodia so well she\u2019s internalized the country\u2019s character traits. At lunch, she waited in line like everyone else, recalls Panh, and she never raised her voice. \u201cHere we don\u2019t shout. We talk,\u201d he says. In Cambodia, yelling is not just disrespectful\u2014it\u2019s also considered a sign of weakness. Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Many eyes were on Maddox, who is as famous in Cambodia as Jolie. \u201cIt was a way for him to walk in the steps that most likely his birth parents walked,\u201d says Jolie, who wasn\u2019t sure how he\u2019d ultimately react to the experience. Would he connect? Would he want to flee? Jolie was thrilled one morning during the shoot when she heard Maddox say, \u201cCan I go sleep in my house with my friends?,\u201d referring to their house in the jungle, which she had bought back in 2002. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard him refer to it that way. You can\u2019t push it. You can\u2019t say, \u2018Isn\u2019t this great?\u2019 You just have to kind of keep bringing them there, putting it in front of them . . . and hope that they find the pride and find the comfort.\u201d She considers the endeavor to connect Maddox to his homeland\u2014as she does Zahara to Ethiopia and Pax to Vietnam\u2014a family effort, not a solo one. With that in mind, while Pitt was in the Middle East working on War Machine, the other five kids also went to Cambodia and played a role, official or not, in their mother\u2019s movie. Pax did still photography. The other four were on set every day and became close playmates with the child actors. In February, the film premiered for an audience of 1,000 at the outdoor amphitheater near the temple complex of Angkor Wat. According to numerous reports, it was a screening filled with tears of recognition, remembrance, and catharsis. What moved Jolie perhaps more than anything was that \u201cthe Cambodian people had a big movie premiere. They saw a movie for which they made the sets. [It was] their actors doing a great job, their country looking beautiful even through all the horrors.\u201d  Alas, while she was making film history for a country, her relationship with Pitt was suffering. By the time First They Killed My Father was in postproduction, in the summer of 2016, \u201cthings got bad,\u201d says Jolie. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to use that word. . . . Things became \u2018difficult.\u2019\\u2009\u201d There has been Hollywood talk that their lifestyle had taken its toll on Pitt, and that he was craving a more stable, normal life for the whole family. When I bring this question up to her, it\u2019s the one moment when Jolie becomes a bit defensive. \u201c[Our lifestyle] was not in any way a negative,\u201d she says quickly, adamantly. \u201cThat was not the problem. That is and will remain one of the wonderful opportunities we are able to give our children . . . They\u2019re six very strong-minded, thoughtful, worldly individuals. I\u2019m very proud of them.\u201d Jolie has indicated that, for the sake of the kids, she doesn\u2019t want to talk about the breakup. And yet it seems she wants to get her point across, which calls for a careful choice of words, something of a high-wire act. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very brave. They were very brave.\u201d \u201cIn times they needed to be.\u201d Other statements are similarly cryptic. \u201cWe\u2019re all just healing from the events that led to the filing . . . They\u2019re not healing from divorce. They\u2019re healing from some . . . from life, from things in life.\u201d I mention Pitt\u2019s mea culpa in GQ Style. Did it surprise her? \u201cNo,\u201d she replies, looking unmoved. I refer to tabloid reports that suggest their communication has improved, and ask if that\u2019s true. There\u2019s a long pause. She looks down, formulates an answer. \u201cWe care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal.\u201d There\u2019s anger and pain right there beneath the surface. But she\u2019s trying to keep the emotions at bay. \u201cI was very worried about my mother, growing up\u2014a lot. I do not want my children to be worried about me. I think it\u2019s very important to cry in the shower and not in front of them. They need to know that everything\u2019s going to be all right even when you\u2019re not sure it is.\u201d Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl. Her protectiveness over the kids has become all that more fierce due to her recent brushes with the specter of ovarian cancer; the disease took her mother\u2019s life when she was just 56, as well as those of other family members. In a 2013 New York Times op-ed column, Jolie chronicled her decision to have a preventive double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery after she learned she had the BRCA1 gene. Two years later, while working in the editing room on By the Sea, she got a call from the doctor saying that he was concerned about certain levels in her blood work that potentially suggested cancer. \u201cTen minutes later, the room\u2019s spinning, and you just think, How . . . ?\u201d She kept the news from the kids, did further tests, and waited a few agonizing days. When she finally learned she didn\u2019t have cancer, \u201cI dropped to my knees.\u201d She made an appointment to get her ovaries taken out. \u201cI went into the actual surgery happy as they come. I was skipping. Because at that point it was just preventative.\u201d She instantly went into menopause. Last year, in addition to hypertension, Jolie developed Bell\u2019s palsy, a result of damage to facial nerves, causing one side of her face to droop. \u201cSometimes women in families put themselves last,\u201d she says, \u201cuntil it manifests itself in their own health.\u201d Jolie credits acupuncture for her full recovery from the condition. Lately, her skin has become drier, she reports, and she has extra gray hairs. She quips, \u201cI can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s menopause or if it\u2019s just been the year I\u2019ve had.\u201d The idea that she could still be anyone\u2019s idea of a sex symbol is laughable to her. But she says, \u201cI actually feel more of a woman because I feel like I\u2019m being smart about my choices, and I\u2019m putting my family first, and I\u2019m in charge of my life and my health. I think that\u2019s what makes a woman complete.\u201d Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl.  Tomorrow, Jolie and the kids are headed to Africa. They\u2019re visiting Namibia, where Shiloh was born, and Kenya, where Jolie will be checking in with a project connected to the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative, an organization she co-founded with British former foreign secretary William Hague. Specifically, members of the British military and peacekeepers will be receiving training in how to protect women from sexual violence in crisis zones. It\u2019s not the obvious dream itinerary for a kid, and Jolie admits that she\u2019s started to get a little pushback with the older ones. \u201cI\u2019m conscious that the boys are teenage boys, and maybe they\u2019d rather be watching TV with their friends, and they\u2019ve been to Africa, and they may not be as excited as the little ones. But they don\u2019t really challenge me. They just kind of sit on the edge of my bed and say, \u2018What are we going to do there?\u2019\\u2009\u201d She assured them that she\u2019d planned fun activities for them, like sandboarding. In any case, \u201cthey know that it\u2019s important, and they know that Mom thinks that it\u2019s going to be important when they\u2019re older.\u201d She knows it sounds a little strange, but Jolie can\u2019t help who she is. \u201cI never woke up and thought, I really want to live a bold life. I just can\u2019t do the other. It\u2019s the same as I can\u2019t make a casserole. I cannot sit still.\u201d For all her earlier talk about being interested in keeping house, now, as the conversation turns to Africa, she\u2019s champing at the bit, desperate to flee. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying for nine months to be really good at just being a homemaker and picking up dog poop and cleaning dishes and reading bedtime stories. And I\u2019m getting better at all three. But now I need to get my boots on and go hang, take a trip.\u201d She believes that her personal will is infectious. The other day she made some joke to Knox along the lines of \u201cPretend to be normal.\u201d \u201cHe said, \u2018Who wants to be normal? We\u2019re not normal. Let\u2019s never be normal.\u2019 Thank you\u2014yes! We\u2019re not normal. Let\u2019s embrace being not normal!\u201d Photograph by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott. Styled by Jessica Diehl.

',\n 'The Mystery of How Kendall Met the Hadids Has Been Solved  Not too long ago Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid were just two young, unconnected girls who occasionally appeared on their family members\\' reality television show. Then the world blinked and all the sudden they were burgeoning supermodels and super influencers. Then the world blinked again and they were bonafide supermodel BFFs. Another blink and their sisters, Kylie and Bella, were also burgeoning influence and burgeoning models in their own right.  One more blink and they\\'re now four of the most famous young women on the entire planet and they all hang out with each other in various groupings and form the core of one of the most powerful girl squads in the entire world.  Of this we all know, and, yet, what we did not know is how any of them actually came to actually know each other and became friends in the first place.  There were simple guesses: Kendall and Gigi just met on the fashion circuit and took a liking to one another.  There were more complicated guesses based on the fact that the two pairs of sisters are sort of \"related\" in the way that all European royal families are sort of related\u2014through a complicated string of marriages and divorces. The story: before Kris Jenner, the Jenners\\' father Caitlyn\u2014n\u00e9e Bruce\u2014used to be married to a woman named Linda, and after their divorce Linda married the composer David Foster. Linda and David also got divorced, and then the Hadids\\' mother Yolanda married David after her first marriage to the sisters\\' biological father Mohamed. Naturally, Yolanda and David are now divorced as well.  So, maybe some assumed they just met at a very awkward extended family reunion, of sorts.  As it happens, that is not the case.  Earlier this year came a stunning new clue in the mystery. While everyone thought that it was Kendall and Gigi who were the original nexus of the friendship web, it turned out that Kendall was actually friends with Bella first.  Now, finally, after far too long spent thinking about this, we have a definitive answer and it is way, way more mundane and even a bit geekier than we ever imagined.  \"I met her for the first time seven years ago over Twitter,\" Bella told InStyle . \u201cThat was before we started modeling; I was probably 14 or 15. We met up and had sushi, and now we\u2019re best friends. She\u2019s a pretty significant human I met online.\u201d  While there is still shame in this world about admitting you\\'ve met anyone online, the fact that two of the most popular girls in the world did so back when they were \"14 or 15\" should satisfy everyone, and, once and for all, any questions about how the Jenners met the Hadids.

For a pair of very famous people they\u2019ve managed to avoid the cameras for ages, though in the last year they seemed to be making less of an effort to hide, even spotted in May boarding a private plane in Paris, where Foxx was filming Robin Hood. At the same time, tabloids claimed that the two were \u201cready to go public.\u201d  And now, perhaps, that glorious time has come. A photograph on the Daily Mail captures the two holding hands on the beach in Malibu\u2014not exactly walking a red carpet together or making it Instagram-official, but the only public display of affection ever witnessed from these two in the wild.  The two have been rumored to take Secret Service-level precautions in their relationship; they reportedly took secret back elevators and cars with tinted windows on dates that seemed more like undercover missions. But in mid-April, a source told Us Weekly that Holmes, who has largely kept her life with her 11-year-old daughter, Suri Cruise, private, no longer wanted to play \u201cthe hiding game\u201d that she and Foxx had mastered since they were first seen together in the late summer of 2013.  Five years since her divorce from Tom Cruise, Holmes remains a frequent tabloid subject, though her and Foxx\u2019s efforts and secrecy have paid off; most headlines focus on her relationship with daughter Suri, or maybe her fashion choices, rather than any romance rumors. In February, just before she and Foxx began to tease out their public relationship, Holmes told Town & Country that, regardless of what gets printed, she and Suri aren\u2019t paying attention anyway.  \u201cIn today\u2019s world a lot of celebrities probably shield their children from the tabloids; in my household we know what they print isn\u2019t true, so we don\u2019t pay attention.\u201d ',\n 'Kanye West, No \\'American Idol\\' For Me  No \\'American Idol\\' For Me  Kanye West is not in discussions with NBC or anyone else about doing a re-boot of \"American Idol\" ... contrary to reports.

',\n 'Kristen Stewart not dropping another \"Twilight\" film, talks sexuality  Possible new \"Twilight\" film can see Kristen Stewart reprising her role as Bella Swan, with a new report claiming that she did not drop movie plans with former beau, Robert Pattinson (Edward Cullen). Some reports say that Stewart said no to her reunion project with Pattinson as she is busy with the psychological thriller, \"Underwater.\" \"Twilight\" fans however can keep their peace as the actress did not reject playing Bella once more.  Reportedly, Stewart has not dropped the possibility for another film with Pattinson because there has been no official plan for the film yet. According to Gossip Cop, the actress\\' casting in her upcoming film does not directly affect the saga should it be revived.  On the contrary, it seems the actress hints interest for another \"Twilight\" film. She previously told Press Association (via Metro) that she will be among the first to read the continuation of the saga as soon as Stephanie Meyer publishes it.  \"I would definitely be the first to read it, yeah,\" she said. There is no official confirmation from Meyer yet if she will be releasing a new book anytime soon. But it looks like it is the only thing that producers are waiting for to start pre-production of a new movie.  Meanwhile, the actress has opened up about herself with the Sunday Times. \"I didn\\'t talk about my first relationships that went public because I wanted things that are mine to be mine,\" she said. A previous Elle interview shares why she doesn\\'t tend to share much about her personal life.  But eventually, Stewart realised that she had several eyes on her and that talking about her personal life can benefit someone else. \"It was an opportunity to surrender a bit of what was mine, to make even one other person feels good about themselves,\" she added.  She was in a relationship with Pattinson but the couple broke up in 2013. Last year, the actress came out as a lesbian. She was in a relationship with visual effects producer, Alicia Cargile.  The final \"Twilight\" film was released in 2012. Since then, the actress has appeared in a series of films such as Olivier Assayas\\' \"The Clouds of Sils Maria,\" for which she won the Cesar Award for Best Supporting Actress. Stewart has also played Jodie Foster\\'s daughter in the thriller \"Panic Room,\" in which she got a Young Artist Award nomination for Best Leading Actress in a Feature Film.

As chronicled in Rakontor's Square Grouper, the home was once the headquarters of the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church.  The Rastafari church (which isn't really Ethiopian not Coptic) bought the home back in 1975, and their marijuana-loving ways didn't please the neighbors much. So, even Elizabeth Hassleback would have preferred Rosie as a neighbor compared to the previous tenants.  The home boasts 11,104 square feet of space, two guest homes and 200 feet of bay frontage.  O'Donnell, who originally listed the home for close to $20 million, reportedly sold the home because she had barely been using in recent years, according to The New York Post.  \",\n \"Selena Gomez gushes over Jenifer Aniston at Cake party  Selena Gomez may be one of the biggest household names in the world, but even she fangirls over her favourite actresses.  And she got to meet one of her heroes, Jennifer Aniston, 45, at a party to celebrate the Friends star's new film Cake in Los Angeles on Friday night.  Selena, 22, and Jennifer certainly seemed to get on well as they hugged in a photo taken after a special screening of the movie at Directors Guild Of America.  Both actresses wore black to the party hosted by Perrier-Jouet And Cinelou Films at Chateau Marmont's Bar, and Selena made sure to get a picture for her Instagram account.  The Spring Breakers star wrote: 'I have not only been following her career as a fan since I was 8 and now get to watch her completely transform in her new movie CAKE, I have gotten to have real conversations with such a real heart, made my entire year. #cake #goseeit'  Aniston's new film has certainly drummed up some Oscar buzz for the actress known more for her comedy work than dramatic.  In the film she plays a woman who suffers from chronic pain and after seeing visions of a member of her support group who committed suicide, seeks out the dead woman's husband.  The film features a stellar ensemble cast including Anna Kendrick, Sam Worthington, William H. Macy, Felicity Huffman and Mamie Gummer (daughter of Meryl Streep).  The Oscar talk hasn't been too comfortable for Jennifer, who told the New York Post's Confidenti@l: that the praise is 'awkward and I'm flattered and humbled.'  Speaking of her transformation into the scarred Claire Simmons, the actress said: 'I gave myself about six weeks to really just disappear and connect with (the character) and this trauma, which is unthinkable.  'And I was just so excited and I ticked all the boxes in the actor dream role.'  Cake is out in US cinemas for a limited release this December but will go nationwide in January 2015 and in the UK on 20 February \",\n 'Keeping Up With Kendall Jenner  When it was announced last week that Kendall Jenner would be the new face of Est\u00e9e Lauder, a coveted contract that in the past has gone to actresses like Gwyneth Paltrow and Elizabeth Hurley and supermodels like Joan Smalls, the company did not promote the news by way of the usual public-relations machine, with news releases or email blasts.  Instead, after Vogue broke the story on its website, in anticipation of a 13-page spread in the magazine, Ms. Jenner was encouraged to tell the public herself, on her own Instagram account. That post quickly garnered more than a million \"likes,\" 50,000-plus comments and many, many heart-eyed emoji.  It was the latest plum appointment for Ms. Jenner, 19, a daughter of Kris and Bruce Jenner, and a half sister to Kim, Khlo\u00e9 and Kourtney Kardashian. Her seemingly meteoric rise over the last few years has taken her from a sulky minor player on the sometimes cringe-inducing but highly successful reality show \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" to a tentative career as a teenage model to the runways of the major fashion shows (Chanel, Marc Jacobs and Givenchy, among them). Along the way, she has all but redefined what it takes to become a high-profile model.  Ms. Jenner is tall, dark-haired, doe-eyed and beautiful. But so are hundreds of other girls who walk the runways of New York, Milan and Paris and thousands more who dream of one day doing so. What they don\\'t have are Ms. Jenner\\'s 16 million followers on Instagram, 9.1 million on Twitter and 7.3 million likes on Facebook (numbers that will surely have grown by the time you read this). Like many other 19-year-old girls, she uses these accounts to share photos of herself, her family and friends. Unlike many 19-year-old girls, she also uses them to plug her many partnerships and commercial projects.  \"I think what\\'s so exciting about her is that she has this social media influence along with a fashion credibility in a distinct way that speaks to millennials,\" said Jane Hertzmark Hudis, the global brand president of Est\u00e9e Lauder. \"There is really no one else like her out there.\" Like her older siblings, with their retail stores, fragrance lines, nail polishes and more, Ms. Jenner juggles multiple brand extensions premised on her family fame. With her younger sister, Kylie, she is marketing a collection of clothes and accessories for PacSun, one of shoes for Steve Madden\\'s Madden Girl line and a science-fiction young adult novel set in a dystopian future colony called Indra.  But the Kardashian affiliation that first brought her to the world\\'s attention has put her on a peculiar perch: followed by millions but navigating aversion in a cloistered industry accustomed to minting its own stars, and a historically wary - but steadily warming - relationship with the Kardashian family. (Ms. Jenner\\'s agent and several of her clients, including Ms. Hudis, claimed not to watch \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians,\" now filming its 10th season.)  \"It\\'s definitely two different worlds. I feel like Hannah Montana. But it\\'s fun,\" Ms. Jenner said, referring to Miley Cyrus\\'s character, who navigates a double life in and out of the spotlight, on the Disney sitcom that began her career and pop stardom. (Of course, both of Ms. Jenner\\'s worlds are squarely in the public eye.)  For modeling purposes, and with a touch of wishful thinking, Ms. Jenner prefers to go by simply \"Kendall.\" In person, she is charming but terse, with a daffy sweetness if not necessarily the gift of gab.  When she presented at the 2014 Billboard Music Awards, she famously muffed her lines, dissolving into giggles and admitting, \"Guys, I\\'m the worst reader.\" At a fitting at Marc Jacobs\\'s office - during which a crowd of teenage girls gathered outside of the building, hoping to catch a glimpse of her - she was taken with a publicist\\'s striking eye color. \"Are those your real eyes?\" she asked.  She arrived for a recent interview at her agency\\'s office dressed model-casual: C\u00e9line slip-on sneakers, a black T-shirt and skinny pants (tag still on) by which designer she wasn\\'t sure. They had shown up unbidden at her house, like much else, a perk not every model enjoys.  She is the first to acknowledge that she was not always interested in style. \"On Season 1 of our show, I would wear, like, neon green jeans and a white polo shirt, the craziest things,\" she said, though in her defense, when \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" premiered in 2007, Ms. Jenner was 11 years old.  She called modeling a lifelong dream. \"I would literally sit at home and have my friends take pictures of me on my little Canon camera that my mom gave me for Christmas,\" she said. \"Obviously, the show was me being in front of a camera. It\\'s just something that I\\'ve kind of always been around.\" Initial forays into modeling were small in scale. In 2011, Ms. Jenner appeared in the New York Fashion Week show of Sherri Hill, a designer from Austin, Tex., who specializes in event and prom dresses.  Earlier that year, Ms. Jenner\\'s appearance at a shoot of Ms. Hill\\'s dresses had been a plot point on an episode of \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\" But Ms. Jenner\\'s role on the show had largely been as a sidekick to her scenery-chewing sisters.  With a new agency, The Society Management, specializing in high-end fashion bookings, behind her, Ms. Jenner is now working to rebrand. \"We had to be very strategic and specific,\" she said, \"to really have people take me seriously and not mess around.\"  The perceived divide between commercial and high fashion is so wide that, when asked whether Ms. Jenner\\'s well-documented Sherri Hill appearance had been her New York Fashion Week debut, a Society representative declined to confirm, writing, \"we recall her as still being in school during that period.\"  With a name like hers, fairly or not, there have been detractors for as long as there have been supporters.  \"It always comes as a shock when I tell the story of how I casted Kendall,\" Riccardo Tisci wrote in an email about his decision to use Ms. Jenner in his Givenchy show and ad campaign. \"I didn\\'t do it because of my links to her sister or to Kanye, as everyone seems to believe. I only chose Kendall because I thought she was amazing, a striking, dark, edgy beauty, exactly the way I like them.\"  Even with prominent advocates, Ms. Jenner\\'s rise was freighted with uncertainty. \"Her agent was very aware that she had one shot at being a credible model,\" said the stylist and Love Magazine editor Katie Grand, an early champion, who in February orchestrated Ms. Jenner\\'s return to New York Fashion Week by placing her in Marc Jacobs\\'s show.  When The Society first asked her to consider Ms. Jenner, Ms. Grand was reluctant. \"I didn\\'t even really know who she was other than someone I thought went skiing with Harry Styles once,\" she said, alluding to Ms. Jenner\\'s alleged former beau. (The rumor mill has linked Ms. Jenner to Mr. Styles, of One Direction, and Justin Bieber, among others.)  Ms. Grand said her first reaction was \"underwhelmed.\" Ms. Jenner\\'s shyness can read as standoffish, and she is still developing the presence that can distinguish a top model. Even today on the runway, she can often blend into the endless parade of willowy but indeterminable young women, without the identifiable prowl of a model like Karlie Kloss, or the seasoned charisma of one like Naomi Campbell.  Ms. Jenner\\'s agent begged for one more appointment. On a follow-up visit, Ms. Grand found her less shy, more spirited and ambitious. \"There\\'s lots of people that I\\'ve worked with at a time before they kicked into the fashion world or fashion consciousness,\" she said. \"Marc is very aware of that, because we\\'ve worked together for so long. He kind of humors me a bit. It\\'s always a bit of an eye glaze and \\'Really? Are we really going to do that?\\' \"  They did. Mr. Jacobs, initially skeptical, came around, largely because, Ms. Grand said, \"she looked really good in the clothes.\" The reaction, thanks in no small part to the look Ms. Jenner wore - which included a breast-baring, sheer top - was immediate. \"I was in a car on the way to the airport immediately after the show to go to London,\" Ms. Grand said. \"I was just looking through Twitter and it was everywhere. I think I didn\\'t really realize it would be such a thing.\"  But despite the ensuing cacophony (not only from fashion blogs, but also The Daily Mail, Fox News and more), Ms. Jenner kept a limited schedule that season, walking only for Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Tisci, Giles Deacon in London (another Ms. Grand client) and Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel.  More followed. She appeared in Chanel\\'s Couture show in July and on the cover of Ms. Grand\\'s Love Magazine. During the Spring 2015 season in September, she expanded her show list to add Diane von Furstenberg, Tommy Hilfiger and Dolce & Gabbana, among others. She is one of a handful of models in the new Karl Lagerfeld spring ad campaign, and is said to be in spring ads for Marc Jacobs as well. (Michael Ariano, a representative for Marc Jacobs, said he could neither confirm nor deny this.)  Although she said she was happiest to go unrecognized at castings and shows - even, in one case, being asked by a makeup artist, \"Did you know Kendall Jenner is here?\" - the media has noted her every appearance, and stoked rumors.  In Touch Weekly reported that other models, threatened by Ms. Jenner\\'s ascendancy, taunted her by putting out cigarettes in her drink. (Ms. Jenner\\'s representatives dispute this.) OK! Magazine splashed a runway shot and a photo of a weeping Kim across its cover under the headline, \"Kendall: \\'I\\'m the Hot One Now!\\' \"  There are those in the industry who resent the intrusion of celebrity into the hermetic runway world, though Ms. Jenner\\'s high profile largely ensures that they complain privately rather than publicly. Ms. Jenner is not the only model to make the leap - her friends Gigi Hadid, a daughter of the \"Real Housewife of Beverly Hills\" Yolanda Foster, and Hailey Baldwin, a daughter of Stephen Baldwin, have, too - but she is the most famous.  Photo  Ms. Jenner. Credit Bon Duke for The New York Times Ms. Jenner\\'s dual citizenship, as it were, in the realms of fashion and celebrity is a decisive factor in her appeal.  After the announcement of her Est\u00e9e Lauder campaign, social media responded, both in favor of Ms. Jenner\\'s appointment and opposed to it. \"@EsteeLauder Have you lost your mind...\" asked one user on Twitter. \"Do you really understand your customer base... Where did you pluck Kendall Jenner from\"?  But its executives know both who their customers are - in the United States and Europe, women as close to Kris Jenner\\'s age as to Kendall\\'s - and who they hope new ones might be. According to data provided by the company, on the Saturday of the announcement, Est\u00e9eLauder.com received six times the number of unique visitors as on an average Saturday. Within 48 hours of the announcement, 90 percent of visitors to the site were first-timers, 71 percent viewing the site on a mobile device.  \"It speaks volumes to where we are right now in terms of nontraditional media,\" said Chris Gay, the general manager of The Society, of the Est\u00e9e Lauder campaign. \"Millennials are not into traditional media. How they\\'re getting their media is completely fractured.\"  As models have gone from muses to marketing partners, their social presences, global reach and audience engagement have become a more important part of their appeal. \"There\\'s no Q ratings for models,\" Mr. Gay said, referring to Q Scores, a measurement of consumer awareness of and favorability toward brands, characters and personalities. \"That was never part of the equation. But now you have real analytics.\"  (The Q Scores Company does in fact track a number of models. Ms. Jenner has an awareness percentage of 33 among the general population, which puts her in line with actresses like Kerry Washington, and only 2 percentage points below Gisele B\u00fcndchen, the world\\'s highest-paid model. Her Q score, measuring the percentage of respondents who called her one of their favorites, is 10 to Ms. B\u00fcndchen\\'s 13.)  Ms. Jenner\\'s friend Olivier Rousteing, the creative director of Balmain, depended less on analytics than personal experience when he decided, after spending time with her at Kim Kardashian and Kanye West\\'s wedding, to cast her in his spring show. But he was not insensitive to the pull she exerts on young women worldwide.  \"She\\'s really communicating to a lot of girls,\" he said. \"You know, like those models in the 90s, Claudia, Naomi - young girls were dreaming of being a model. I think Kendall is bringing these things. Girls are dreaming about how to be her.\"  Ms. Jenner did not care to parse the various interpretations the world has offered on her rise.  \"Some people are hesitant with me, and they just worry or wonder for a second,\" she said. \"But then when the chance gets taken . ...\"  ',\n 'Inside Beyonc\u00e9\\'s baby shower  Don\\'t act like you didn\\'t know Beyonc\u00e9 was going to shut it down when it came to her baby shower.

Lawrence\u2019s guest, Kim Kardashian West, was happy to answer all of the Oscar-winning actress\u2019 questions.      While talking with Kardashian, Lawrence revealed to the audience of \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d that she had dinner with the reality star\u2019s mom, Kris Jenner, and the two had a few too many.   \u201cI drank five martinis and wound up naked in her closet, I\u2019m dead serious,\u201d Lawrence told the audience.  \"I\\'ve never seen my mom more drunk in our lives,\" Kardashian said. \"It was so funny.\"   Kardashian said the \u201cmother!\u201d star asked the reality diva and her rapper husband Kanye West to dress her.  \u201cYou said, \u2018I\u2019m not joking, I really want Kanye to style me and so I said, \u2018OK.\u2019 I come back in and you\u2019re fully butt naked,\u201d Kardashian said.  After the two reminisced about the evening, Lawrence asked the mother of two if she had talked to O.J. Simpson since he was freed from prison.  Lawrence also asked if Kardashian thought it was a coincidence her ex-boyfriend Reggie Bush\u2019s wife \u201clooked like you.\u201d The reality star laughed the question off.  Lawrence has previously said she is a fan of \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians\u201d and even introduced the show to her \u201cmother!\u201d co-star Javier Bardem, People reported.   ',\n \"Anderson Cooper on Kathy Griffin: 'I hope she bounces back'  Anderson Cooper has made it clear that he isn\u2019t pleased with Kathy Griffin\u2018s controversial photo of Donald Trump, but the CNN anchor says he hopes his longtime friend can make a comeback after the headline-making ordeal.  \u201cI don\u2019t want anybody\u2019s career to be destroyed because they do something unfortunate and inappropriate,\u201d Cooper said during his Friday appearance at Arizona\u2019s Comerica Theatre alongside Andy Cohen, according to USA Today.  He later added: \u201cLook, I wish her well and I hope she bounces back and keeps doing what she does best, which is make people laugh.\u201d  Griffin has been at the center of a media storm since she posed for a photo with a replica of Trump\u2019s bloodied, decapitated head in her hand last month. She later acknowledged in a Twitter video that she \u201ccrossed the line\u201d with the display.  She apologized again at an emotional press conference as CNN fired her from her annual New Year\u2019s Eve hosting duties alongside Cooper.  \u201cCNN made the decision not to bring her back,\u201d Cooper said at Friday\u2019s event. \u201cI had nothing to do with it, but I certainly understand why they made that decision.\u201d  In the wake of the photo, Cooper condemned Griffin\u2019s action in a tweet, writing, \u201cFor the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.\u201d  The journalist noted that he had a right, as Griffin\u2019s friend, to speak out against the picture.  \u201cPeople were assuming I was somehow responsible for this and I just felt I should point out that I actually think this is pretty important as somebody who works overseas and, you know, journalists get beheaded and this is not a joke,\u201d he said. \",\n 'Watch Barack Obama\\'s sweet surprise for Michelle on their 25th anniversary  Already known for his sweet messages to his wife on birthdays and holidays, Barack Obama went big for his 25th wedding anniversary with Michelle on Tuesday.  He surprised the former first lady with a heart-melting video message while she was in the middle of a talk with television producer Shonda Rhimes at the Pennsylvania Conference for Women in Philadelphia.  \"I better get home!\" a smiling and blushing Michelle said to Rhimes and the audience after seeing the message.  Barack appeared on screen at the conference near the end of a 57-minute talk by Michelle. (Jump to the 54-minute mark in the video.) He apologized to the attendees for having to \"crash this party,\" before letting his wife know what she means to him.  \"Now, the idea that you would even put up with me for a quarter of a century is a remarkable testament to what a saintly, wonderful, patient person you are,\\'\\' he said. \"It was a lot easier for me to do it because the fact of the matter is that not only have you been an extraordinary partner, not only have you been a great friend, somebody who could always make me laugh, somebody who would always make sure that I was following what I thought was right, but you have also been an example to our daughters and to the entire country.\"  His sentiments came after Michelle had posted a photo from their 1992 wedding on Instagram with a message of love for the former president on their anniversary.  \"Your strength, your grace, your determination, your honesty, the fact that you look so good doing all this, the way in which you\\'ve always taken responsibility for your own actions but also for looking out for the people around you is remarkable,\\'\\' he continued. \"And it\\'s no wonder that as people got to know you the way that I got to know you, they fell in love.\"  His message was the latest example of the type of genuine affection between the two that was often on display in many touching moments throughout the eight years they were in the White House.  Barack and Michelle have been together since 1989, when he met her while working as a summer associate at a Chicago law firm where she worked.  \"It is truly the best decision that I ever made to be persistent enough, asking you out on a date, that you finally gave in,\\'\\' he said. \"And I hope you feel the same way. So, I don\\'t want to interrupt the flow of what I\\'m sure is a fascinating discussion, but I figured that you wouldn\\'t mind maybe me parachuting in just to say how much I love you and how much I appreciate you.\" ',\n 'Kris Jenner Just Broke Her Silence On Kylie\\'s Pregnancy  If you didn\\'t already know that Kylie Jenner is pregnant, well, let me be the first to tell you: Kylie Jenner is pregnant!  She\\'s expecting a child with rapper Travis Scott, whom she\\'s been dating since April. When the news broke yesterday, the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan stayed silent about it \u2014 including Mama Kris.  E! But this morning, while attending an event at Milan Fashion week, Kris gave an interview with The Cut \u2014 and she (somewhat reluctantly) broke her silence.  Tristan Fewings / Getty Images \"Did you know the news was going to break about Kylie?\" the interviewer asked.  \"I just woke up this morning,\" Kris replied. \"She\u2019s not confirmed anything. I think it\u2019s kind of wild that everyone is just assuming that that\u2019s just happening.\"  While Kris did not confirm the news herself, she also didn\\'t deny it, adding: Something happens every single day. You never know what is going to break at any moment. Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.   While Kylie hasn\\'t released an official statement on the matter, multiple outlets are reporting the news. TMZ was the first to break the story, and cited multiple sources.  A source with knowledge of the situation also confirmed the pregnancy to BuzzFeed.  And Kylie\\'s Instagram has featured some older pics as of late.

Among the many revelations in the 30-minute chat \u2014 which touched on everything from Carrey\u2019s political paintings and sculptures\\xa0to\\xa0the DREAMers to the white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia\\xa0to Kathy Griffin\u2018s recent controversy \u2014 was a tender moment in which Carrey said he\u2019s embraced hopelessness in his life a means of coping with difficulties.  \u201cThere\u2019s a virtue in hopelessness,\u201d Carrey said. \u201cI\u2019m not kidding. You\u2019re off the hook and you don\u2019t have to worry about what\u2019s coming. \u2018Okay, the world freaking ended. That\u2019s great. Now what?'\u201d  \u201cGive up! Surrender to the idea that things are bad and yet still, from 3,000 feet up, we don\u2019t matter,\u201d he continued. \u201cThings are happening and we\u2019re going to happen along with them whether we like it or not. But we don\u2019t matter. \u2026 Once you lose yourself, you\u2019re pretty okay. Just get you out of the way.\u201d  While Carrey\u2019s advice was sparked by Moore\u2019s questions about the Trump presidency, the Truman Show star said his\\xa0philosophy was born out of pain he\u2019s gone through in the past.  \u201cWe\u2019re all so afraid of the river of tears,\u201d Carrey said, explaining that he, like many, had avoided his problems in the past with \u201cfood and sex and noise and gadgets.\u201d  \u201cThe fact is, going down the river of sorrow and suffering is the way to freedom,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ve gone through it and I\u2019m telling you, you don\u2019t survive it. You don\u2019t come out of it on the other side. You might come out of it with a body, but there\u2019s no you attached to it.\u201d  He added: \u201cIt\u2019s tough to be yourself if you don\u2019t have a self.\u201d  Carrey has been open about struggling with depression since his youth. The past few years have been difficult ones: In 2015, his on-and-off girlfriend\\xa0Cathriona White\\xa0 died by suicide.\\xa0Since then he\u2019s been involved in legal battles with her family over\\xa0wrongful death\\xa0allegations, which he denies.  Carrey told Moore that choosing what part he wants to play in life has helped him move forward.  \u201cKnow that no matter what happens, this is not who you are,\u201d Carrey said. \u201cYou choose the part you want to play in this life. I want to be a good guy. I want to do good things. I want to make people happy and I want to help out when I can. So you do what you need to do.\u201d  Elsewhere in his chat with Moore \u2014 which came towards the end of the the Oscar-winning director\u2019s impassioned two-and-a-half hour one-man show \u2014 Carrey laid into President Trump, claiming the 71-year-old former\\xa0Celebrity Apprentice\\xa0host deceived working-class voters into thinking he wasn\u2019t a member of the \u201celite\u201d group he had so aggressively attacked during his campaign.  \u201cThey say that the best trick the devil ever did was convincing people that he didn\u2019t exist, but I think the best trick was convincing 40 percent of this country that this truffle pig who spends half of his presidency gargling caviar behind the wheel of a golf cart isn\u2019t the elite,\u201d Carrey said. \u201cHe has a golden f\u2014\u2014 apartment. It\u2019s just incredible.\u201d  \u201cHow does he do that with a baseball cap?\u201d Carrey asked. \u201cI used to think Clark Kent\u2019s disguise was flimsy. \u2018Dude you\u2019re Superman, you\u2019re busting out of the suit, it\u2019s obvious!\u2019 Trump makes that look intricate.\u201d  Carrey also criticized what he called \u201ca war on intelligence and discernment in this country,\u201d saying that people are \u201cmade to feel guilty for being smart.\u201d  Carrey said that he hopes both Trump supporters and critics find a way to understand one another moving forward \u2014 as \u201cevery person is to be cared about and thought of as precious, including the people that don\u2019t agree with us.\u201d  \u201cI don\u2019t like this trend of, \u2018If you don\u2019t agree with me, it\u2019s hatred,\u2019 \u201d Carrey said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t agree with someone, you don\u2019t agree with them. It doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s hatred. And we have to get back to that and have discourse.

Happy anniversary Peanut Butter!!!!\u201d  Earlier this week Winter dished to Us Weekly about Meaden, saying that they \u201chave a great relationship.\u201d  \u201cHe\u2019s just the loveliest person, he loves me through thick and thin,\u201d she told Us. \u201cHe\u2019s always telling me, no matter what I\u2019m wearing, no matter what I\u2019m doing, that I\u2019m beautiful.\u201d  The couple live together in L.A. in a house that Winter bought last year.  \u201cMy boyfriend and I live together, and he cooks,\u201d she told Jimmy Kimmel this past May. \u201cI can\u2019t cook at all. He takes care of all that handy stuff. He\u2019s great, he does all that. I can bake a pie occasionally. Pumpkin and apple. I baked those two the other day. They were edible.\u201d  ',\n 'Angelina Jolie, Unbroken  \u201cI never expect to be the one that everybody understands or likes,\u201d Angelina Jolie says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s O.K., because I know who I am, and the kids know who I am.\u201d  \u201cI never expect to be the one that everybody understands or likes,\u201d Angelina Jolie says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s O.K., because I know who I am, and the kids know who I am.\u201d  LOS ANGELES \u2014 Angelina Jolie was sitting barefoot on the porch of her luscious new home, explaining why she wants to save the world, when duty called. Her youngest son, Knox, 9, poked his little blond head around the screen door.  \u201cShiloh needs you,\u201d the boy said quietly, referring to his middle sister, who is 11.  \u201cShi?\u201d Ms. Jolie called, before disappearing with a whoosh of her black caftan. Ten minutes later, she was back. Shiloh\u2019s beloved bearded dragon, Vlad, had fallen ill and was now, to Shiloh\u2019s distress, convalescing at the vet\u2019s. \u201cThat will be the rest of my day,\u201d Ms. Jolie said, settling into a cushioned patio chair, \u201clearning all about the health issues of the bearded dragon.\u201d  Ms. Jolie went on to lament the imbalance of a world where Californian pets get cushy care while millions of people the world over lack access to proper medical treatment. It went unmentioned that she was saying this from her $25 million two-acre hilltop estate, in a gated pocket of the Los Feliz neighborhood, a home she bought for herself and her six children in the spring, following her split from Brad Pitt.  Perhaps more than any other celebrity, Ms. Jolie, 42, has kept herself firmly planted in two vastly different worlds. She\u2019s both the glamorous A-lister whose every move is tracked in headlines (\u201cAngie and the kids left Target because it didn\u2019t serve hot dogs,\u201d read one recent newsflash), and the humanitarian do-gooder who has made more than 60 trips to the field as part of her United Nations work. Apparent contradictions account for her elusive allure. Ms. Jolie has been enduringly hard to peg, a woman who cannot easily be lumped into a single category because she occupies many at once.  She is a peerless glamazon as well as the women\u2019s health advocate who told the world about her preventative double mastectomy. She has a meticulously managed public profile yet professes not to care what others think. She remains near the pinnacle of celebrity\u2019s cruel pyramid, even though her recent movies only made money when she was camouflaged (\u201cMaleficent,\u201d \u201cKung Fu Panda\u201d). She is obsessed over \u2014 if, in the United States at least, not exactly beloved \u2014 and fixed in the cultural firmament as America\u2019s vixen despite having a half-dozen-strong brood.  And even though the public appetite for salacious details of her personal life has long eclipsed interest in the films she has directed, Ms. Jolie doggedly brings tough, obscure stories to the screen. Three of the four movies she has made are set in wartime, including her latest, \u201cFirst They Killed My Father,\u201d based on the true story of Loung Ung, who as a young girl survived the Cambodian genocide and is now one of Ms. Jolie\u2019s close friends.  While Ms. Jolie\u2019s earlier movies garnered tepid reviews, several critics have anointed \u201cFirst They Killed My Father\u201d her best yet. It is told entirely from the little girl\u2019s point of view, in Khmer, and received a standing ovation at the Telluride Film Festival, where it had its premiere. Netflix was to begin streaming it on Sept. 15, when it will also open in a small number of theaters.  Ms. Jolie said she could not have made the movie had she not first directed \u201cIn the Land of Blood and Honey\u201d (2011) about the Bosnian war, and \u201cUnbroken\u201d (2014), based on the true story of an American G.I. taken prisoner in World War II. (She and Mr. Pitt starred together as a married couple locked in a different kind of conflict in her 2015 drama, \u201cBy the Sea\u201d).  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a conscious plan of, I was going to make war films, it\u2019s just what I was drawn to,\u201d she said.  Ms. Jolie has an indelible connection to Cambodia, not least because it completely reordered her life. Before first visiting in 2000 to shoot \u201cLara Croft: Tomb Raider,\u201d she had been a Hollywood wild child, a ravishing Goth weirdo who, at the Oscars that year, dressed like Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, and locked lips with her brother. She also got publicly hot and heavy with her second husband, Billy Bob Thornton, and wore a locket with droplets of his blood around her neck.  The grace and humility she saw in the Cambodian people, along with the lasting effects of the genocide, threw Hollywood life into unflattering relief.  \u201cOnce you get exposed to what\u2019s really happening in the world, and other people\u2019s realities, you just can\u2019t ever not know, and you can\u2019t ever wake up and pretend it\u2019s not happening,\u201d she said, \u201cYour entire life shifts.\u201d  She adopted Maddox, now 16, from an orphanage, divorced Mr. Thornton, and threw herself into humanitarian and environmental work, finding lasting inspiration in wartime survivors and aid workers.  \u201cThe real will to survive, and the strength of the human spirit, and the love of the human family becomes so present, and that\u2019s how we should all be living,\u201d Ms. Jolie said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re around it, it\u2019s quite contagious, and you know to learn from it.\u201d  The air pressed in hot and close as she spoke, and the sun was climbing its way toward a broiling midday. I was all but keeling over, but Ms. Jolie, who adores the heat, was as composed as a sphinx. (We soon moved to the air-conditioned climes of her kitchen.)  Ms. Jolie is a contained and poised presence, yet also light, breaking every now and then into lilting laughter. She is as visually arresting as she appears onscreen; the sculpted lines of her face alongside the soft O\u2019s of her eyes and mouth make hers an otherworldly beauty. Though slight as a sylph, she says she doesn\u2019t exercise, beyond dipping into the pool with her kids and vaguely intending to someday jump on a treadmill.  Although it was still August, the children \u2014 Maddox; Pax, 13; Zahara, 12; Shiloh; Knox; and his twin, Vivienne \u2014 had already begun home school. They would be accompanying her to the Telluride and Toronto film festivals \u2014 Maddox has an executive producer credit on the film \u2014 and were making up for lost lesson time, working with tutors in various corners of the house, learning, among other things, Arabic, sign language and physics.  I asked Ms. Jolie if she ever felt like the coach of a small team, and she replied that more often she felt part of a fraternity.  \u201cThey really help me so much. We\u2019re really such a unit,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re the best friends I\u2019ve ever had. Nobody in my life has ever stood by me more.\u201d  That last sentence hung in the air, perhaps a subtle allusion to, or indictment of, Mr. Pitt, who adopted Maddox, Pax and Zahara, and is the biological father of Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne. The dissolution of their 12-year romantic partnership came last September, after an incident aboard a private jet \u2014 purportedly involving Mr. Pitt and Maddox \u2014 prompted her to file for divorce.  Shortly afterward, Ms. Jolie and the kids moved out of Mr. Pitts\u2019s estate, living in a rental for nine months as she struggled with the decision about whether to buy a new home.  \u201cIt took me a few months to realize that I was really going to have to do it. That there was going to have to be another base regardless of everything,\u201d she said, her voice falling quiet and low, as it would each time the subject of the split arose. \u201cThat there was going to have to be a home. Another home.\u201d  The new house, a Beaux Arts manse that was once the residence of the legendary filmmaker Cecil B. DeMille, is a beaut, with a library, rolling lawns, cascading fountains that burble into the pool, and a view of the Griffith Observatory. Ms. Jolie had an elaborate treehouse built \u2014 \u201cmore a parkour treehouse,\u201d she said \u2014 and the kids helped decorate and pick out the furniture for the whole house. They have an agreement, Ms. Jolie said, that not everyone can agree on everything, but you have to try to like it if you don\u2019t hate it. If you do hate it, you can overrule.  \u201cIt has a lot of moments,\u201d Ms. Jolie said of the home, \u201cIt\u2019s happy. Happy and light, and we needed that.\u201d  I asked how everyone is doing now.  \u201cNone of it\u2019s easy. It\u2019s very, very difficult, a very painful situation, and I just want my family healthy,\u201d she said quietly.  Are they? \u201cThey\u2019re getting better,\u201d she said, her voice approaching inaudibility.  She intimated that \u201cFirst They Killed My Father\u201d might have informed her decision to leave Mr. Pitt. The film centers on Ms. Ung\u2019s family members, some of whom survived, and Ms. Jolie said she thought a lot about what family meant during production, and how they should help each other and take care of one another (the film is adapted from Ms. Ung\u2019s 2000 book of the same name).  \u201cLoung had such horrors in her life but also had so much love, and that is why she\u2019s all right today,\u201d Ms. Jolie said. \u201cThat is something I need to remember.\u201d  Determined to make the film as Cambodian as possible, Ms. Jolie teamed with the Cambodian director Rithy Panh, who received an Oscar nomination for his 2014 documentary, \u201cThe Missing Picture,\u201d and enlisted thousands of Cambodians as extras. Ms. Jolie said Maddox was her right-hand man, working on the script, taking meeting notes and bantering with Mr. Panh in French. Some of the scenes were shot on massacre sites, so the crew arranged for monks to pray and set out incense and offerings beforehand.  \u201cShe is very loved there,\u201d said Mr. Panh, who served as a producer on the film. He added that he was struck by Ms. Jolie\u2019s humility, and how she intuitively communicated with the children on set, despite her shaky grasp of the Cambodian language. (Ms. Jolie said a suggestion in Vanity Fair that children were cruelly hoodwinked in the casting process was \u201ca mischaracterization.\u201d)  Ms. Ung said Ms. Jolie, who has Cambodian citizenship, shares her countrymen\u2019s sensibilities. \u201cIn Cambodia you don\u2019t raise your voice, you speak kindly to people, you greet people with your hands together and bow,\u201d Ms. Ung said. \u201cAll of this comes naturally to her.\u201d  As our interview wrapped, Ms. Jolie joked that she would next work on a comedy. \u201cI will get funny at some point,\u201d she said, adding that she was working on \u201cMaleficent 2,\u201d a sequel to the Disney fractured fairy tale. \u201cThat was a little funny,\u201d she said, wryly.  Ms. Jolie also seemed aware of how she might be beheld by the public; the removed ice queen to Mr. Pitt\u2019s affable down-home Missouri boy (his revealing interview in the summer issue of GQ Style helped burnish his image as the more relatable one). But she grew up a punk in school, she said, and was used to not fitting in, and being someone people had opinions about.  \u201cI never expect to be the one that everybody understands or likes,\u201d Ms. Jolie said, walking me down her driveway, \u201cAnd that\u2019s O.K., because I know who I am, and the kids know who I am.\u201d  She quickly embraced me goodbye, and I set off into the sun and the heat, as the heavy security gate slowly drew shut behind.

Cyber bullies didn\\'t hold back, writing things like, \"OJ runnin\\' right back into ya life #DaddysHome,\" \"You\\'re definitely OJ Simpson\\'s child\" and \"Stop taking selfies and go see your dad!\"  Others had her back, reminding the haters how hurtful it was to leave comments like this as her actual father, Robert Kardashian, who was one of Simpson\\'s defense attorneys in the infamous 1995 murder trial, died in 2003. Simpson was found not guilty for the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman.  \"The comments under Khloe\\'s picture is sick,\" a fan on Twitter wrote. \"I\\'m so hurt she needs to deal with this all. Robert Kardashian is her father, leave her in peace.\"  Khloe responded to the tweet, writing, \"People are a**holes but I don\\'t care lol I focus on the good.\"  Another fan chimed in and said, \"People are legit f**ked and it makes me angry.\"  \"They are all f**ked lol such as**oles,\" Khloe wrote. \"Hehe oh well....

The decision was handed down by parole commissioners Connie S. Bisbee, Tony Corda, Adam Endel and Susan Jackson, the same four board members who granted Simpson parole at his July 2013 hearing on his kidnapping, robbery and burglary charges.  During his parole hearing, Simpson said he has lived a largely conflict-free life, and that he had done \"his time.\"  WATCH: OJ Simpson Granted Parole  \"I\\'ve always been a giving guy, even on the streets, people have always come up to me,\" Simpson said, stressing that he\\'s continually served as a peacekeeper in jail among other inmates. \"Right now, I\\'m at a point in my life where I just want to spend as much time with my children and my friends.

Much like Dory, whom we met in the hit 2003 movie Finding Nemo, DeGeneres, 58, is undaunted, kind, strong and loving, swimming on despite the obstacles in her way. But unlike Dory, whose amnesia causes her to remember almost nothing, DeGeneres remembers a whole lot.  The native of Metairie, Louisiana, hasn\u2019t forgotten the slow road to fame in the 1990s and how her first prime-time comedy series, Ellen, was abandoned by advertisers and the TV network when it flopped, capsized in part by backlash and negative response to her \u201ccoming out\u201d as TV\u2019s highest-profile lesbian. Like Dory, she swam on. She went back to doing stand-up comedy, created her own afternoon-TV talk show and hosted the Emmys, Grammys and the Academy Awards\u2014twice.  In 2008, DeGeneres married Australian actress/model Portia de Rossi, 43. Both vegans, they share a passion for animal rights, environmental causes and renovating houses. Parade\u2019s Dotson Rader met with DeGeneres in her office on the back lot of the TV studio complex in Burbank, California, where The Ellen DeGeneres Show has been produced for 13 years.  What was your childhood like? Was it fun?  I grew up in a very conservative home. My father was a first reader in the Christian Science Church, which is similar to being a preacher. There was no drinking, smoking or cursing. I didn\u2019t see deep emotion from my parents. It was all very polite and very surface. I never knew how anybody was feeling. Because of that religion everything was fine all the time.  Isn\u2019t it dishonest to pretend you\u2019re happy when you\u2019re really angry?  Exactly. I never saw anyone angry\u2014so when I was 13 and my parents divorced it was a huge surprise to me because I was told everything was fine. It was very confusing. That\u2019s not a healthy way to grow up. It was very hard to express yourself. A kid should be told that you can have feelings. I have a lot of feelings. You can feel sad and angry and hurt. But the only feeling that was approved of is happiness\u2014that was it. How can you have happiness when you\u2019re not honest?  How did that emotional repression affect you?  As a young girl, I noticed things a lot more. I started seeing that things weren\u2019t completely as everyone said they were. I noticed everything because I had to after my parents divorced. At 13, I sort of became the parent, taking care of my mother.  Did that experience influence your comedy?  I think my comedy came from observing little details in life. What is most important are the details, not the broad strokes but noticing what\u2019s in between. One of my first jokes was the fact that when somebody tastes something disgusting, they always want you to taste it\\xa0too, like, \u201cThis is disgusting\u2014taste it!\u201d And people do.  Why could you see what others never saw?  Because I was very tender. I was very sensitive, and I still am. I never want to hurt anybody. I want to make people laugh. I didn\u2019t think it was ever funny to make fun of people. There\u2019s so much to laugh at without it being at someone else\u2019s expense.  You end each TV show by telling your viewers to be kind to each other. Why is kindness so important to you?  Because I\u2019ve been treated in a way that has not been kind, respectful or considerate. I learned compassion from having experienced some bad stuff.  After your parents divorced, you stayed alone with your mom in New Orleans?  Yes. My mother was going through a hard time. She dated lots of really horrible men and had bad experiences. She went from being my mother to being somebody I was watching date men. At 13, it\u2019s a weird thing. Then she remarried and had breast cancer right away, a really tough thing for her. I had to make her laugh. [My comedy] started from me trying to make her happy. It felt really good to have power to make people happy. That\u2019s my talent. Not that I thought I\u2019d make money from it.  You have an older brother, Vance. What happened to him?  He left, angry. He was 17. He didn\u2019t want to live with either parent. He was in a band. Now we\u2019re very, very close. He\u2019s great. He is very talented and works with my production company.  You went to the University of New Orleans for less than a semester and dropped out. Why?  School just was not interesting to me.  Before Ellen was Ellen: Do You Remember Her 10 Best TV Appearances?  Were you surprised when ABC abruptly canceled your hit sitcom after your character came out?  It was a sucker punch. I didn\u2019t expect it. I knew that there was a big chance that this was the end of my career. But I\u2019m grateful for it. I got to start over again and create this talk show. There are people who don\u2019t know about the sitcoms, or my stand-up comedy. They think I\u2019m just a talk show host. That\u2019s fine with me.  On your talk show, everything is positive, despite what may be happening that\u2019s bad in the real world, say in politics.  I don\u2019t do political humor. I never have. Trump is being attacked by everybody because it\u2019s an easy thing to do. Stephen Colbert goes after him every night and so does Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel. A lot of people do. I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to make fun of anybody. It\u2019s not who I am.  Get\\xa0a Peek at Ellen\u2019s Quirky Design Style in Her New Book Home  Your show seems unrelentingly happy. It is a happy show, on purpose. I represent happiness to a lot of people. I want to keep myself as open and as nonjudgmental as possible. Before the show was picked up, I think a lot of station managers thought I would have an agenda to try to somehow turn the world gay. People did worry. Our only agenda is to make people feel good. It\u2019s an hour of joy.  Your audience squeals with excited delight a lot. There are people from all over the world who wait three years for tickets. I was in Dubai and this woman said she\u2019d been trying to get tickets for five years. That\u2019s why I created the room [for] leftover people who can\u2019t get in. Tom Hanks named it the Riff Raff Room.  You live a very public life with a lot of pressures, among them rumors of marital problems with your wife, Portia. I don\u2019t pay attention [to rumors]. But we\u2019ve been followed recently by the paparazzi, and we found out it\u2019s because there\u2019s a story out there that we\u2019re getting divorced. We don\u2019t know why. We\u2019re together all the time. We genuinely love each other. Her happiness is my happiness, and vice versa. True love is caring more about the other person\u2019s happiness than your own.  ',\n 'Jake Gyllenhaal Is Not Here for Taylor Swift Questions  Left, by Mike Pont/WireImage; Right, from GC Images, both from Getty Images.  In 2010, famously private Jake Gyllenhaal and Taylor Swift dated. Nearly a decade later, he\\'s shutting down questions about it in interviews-this time in The Guardian.  At the time, Gyllenhaal was nine years her senior-a minor scandal-but the relationship only lasted three months. It would have turned into one of the smoldering ember piles of forgotten celebrity relationships that dot the tabloid landscape if not for that maple-latte photo and \"Red,\" the song Swift allegedly wrote about Gyllenhaal, which initiated him into a sort of club: a group of men that have inspired Swift songs.  Now, nearly seven years later, in the year of our Lord 2017, the actor has to contend with the unhappy reality of answering questions about his time with Swift. Call it club dues, made payable to interviewers.  Gyllenhaal has spoken about the relationship without giving too much away before (notably in 2015 on Howard Stern), but he\\'s no longer abiding those questions. Writer Tim Jonze for the The Guardian found that out in an interview, which was ostensibly about the actor\\'s new movie, Life. Here\\'s the tensest part of the exchange, as it\\'s rendered by Jonze:  For someone so intensely private, wasn\\'t it playing with fire a little to start dating [Taylor Swift]? Asking this proves to be a mistake. \"I think when you\\'re in a relationship, you are constantly scrutinised, your friends are scrutinised, but ...\" He trails off and stares at me, ramping up the intensity of his eyes like he\\'s done in so many roles. But what? Gyllenhaal just continues to stare. Then he performs an exaggerated shrug. So, er, did he listen to any of the many songs rumored to be about him? More silence. The atmosphere has become uncomfortably tense. Would he like to move on? \"I would love to not talk about my personal life.\" I don\\'t think this is, massively. \"Oh, really? You don\\'t?\" he asks.  Are you s-h-i-v-e-r-i-n-g yet? Put on another layer because later Gyllenhaal recounts his time meeting Obama and manages to bring it back to The Question. \"[Obama] told me: \\'You have a job as an artist to help people through difficult times, to illuminate things through art.\\' He said: \\'That\\'s your job.\\' And my parents have always said that, too. And I\\'m sure you know it, because you seem like a very smart person who has done their research, particularly into tabloid research, which is obviously the most important of all research.\"  And that\\'s not it for the Siberian tundra of an actor. Still on politics, Gyllenhaal says, \"So, it\\'s an irony to me when people say: \\'An entertainer or actor should not be political,\\' because it\\'s very easy to sideline people and, for instance, ask about past relationships or things that I believe are meant to be private.\"  Gyllenhaal is the iceberg, and Jonze, the Titanic, completely sunk by Gyllenhaal\\'s final act: \"muttering\" to a handler, \"It\\'s always the last [interview of the day].\" We\\'ve all learned a valuable lesson, too. Gyllenhaal\\'s Life is fair game, but his life is not.  Vanity Fair has reached out to Gyllenhaal for comment. ',\n 'Kim Kardashian fails to congratulate Beyonce over twin pregnancy news while BFF Chrissy Teigen appears to mock superstar\\'s announcement  The reality star did not join the list of stars tweeting their joy about Bey\\'s good news  KIM Kardashian failed to share any reaction to Beyonce\\'s record-breaking pregnancy announcement on her social media pages on Wednesday night.  Despite being active and chatting to fans on her Twitter account throughout the night, Kim opted not to follow in the lead of stars like Rita Ora and Rihanna and share public congratulations to the couple.  Kim\\'s public silence did little to dispel the persistent rumours that the two superstars do not get along, despite reports the pair spent time together last year with their husband Jay Z and Kanye West.  Meanwhile, Chrissy Teigen nearly got in trouble with the Beyhive (the nickname for Beyonce\\'s fans) after she appeared to mock the star\\'s dramatic announcement.  As tweets and reaction pieces were taking over the internet, Chrissy wrote: \"Talk about a huge instagram announcement.\"  Tthe accompanying picture was a screenshot which revealed the model had reached 10 million followers.  She then added: \"I am pregnant with 333.3333333333333333333333333333333333333 triplets.\"  But just as fans began to express some anger towards her tweets, mother-of-one Chrissy added: \"But really. Congrats to my best friend Beyonce I love you so much. Hive forever.\"  The first star to congratulate them was Jay Z\\'s long-time friend Rihanna, who wrote: \"So excited about this news!!!! Congratulations to you @beyonce and my big bro Jay!!!\"  Rita Ora, who was falsely linked to Jay Z as possibly \"Becky with the good hair\" after Lemonade was released last year, tweeted with the photo, \"Yay!!!!! Congratulations!!!!! soooooo beautiful!!!!!\"  Model Hailey Baldwin said: \"I feel like I\\'m more excited for Beyonc\u00e9 to be pregnant than I will be for my own child.\"  Actress Brie Larson wrote: \"NO \u2013 YOU ARE CRYING BECAUSE BEYONC\u00c9 IS HAVING TWINS.\"  And Jurassic World star Bryce Dallas Howard declared: \"I think we all really needed this. #twins.\"  Beyonce has claimed the title of having the most liked picture Instagram thanks to her artistic pregnancy announcement.  Wearing a berry coloured bra and a pair of pale blue frilly knickers, the 35-year-old knelt on an elaborate display of roses with a sheer veil over her head.  As she looked directly into the camera, the singer cradled her already visible bump.  She captioned it: \"We would like to share our love and happiness.  \"We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. - The Carters.\"  Beyonce didn\\'t give any further details of when the babies will arrive, but their arrival will come five years after the couple welcomed their first child, daughter Blue Ivy, in January 2012.  The happy news comes nine years after the couple tied the knot in a private wedding ceremony in April 2008.  The star later revealed she had miscarried a child around 2010, describing it as the \"saddest thing\" she had ever been through.  Thankfully they were blessed with daughter Blue Ivy in 2012, but in the last couple of years, the pair had been dogged by rumours they were intended to divorce, not expand their family.  However the latest announcement finally shuts down the speculation once and for all, with the family now looking forward to their new arrivals.  ',\n 'Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z welcome twins  There was no immediate word on the gender of the babies or their names.  The superstar singer and her mogul husband, who married in 2008, are also parents to a five-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy.  Queen Bey announced her pregnancy in February on Instagram.  \"We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. The Carters, \" she posted. ',\n 'Wild Rumor: Justin Bieber Canceled His Purpose Tour to Start His Own Church  Justin Bieber shocked the Belieber community worldwide yesterday when he abruptly canceled the remainder of his Purpose tour. Bieber had 14 shows left, including several in the U.S. and Asia. A photographer caught the Biebs yesterday in L.A., and he explained he just needed a break after 16 months of touring. \"Yeah, everything\\'s fine, yeah\" he told the man on camera. \"I\\'ve been on tour for two years. It is [a long stretch,] yeah. Yes, [I\\'m looking forward] to resting, getting some relaxation, I\\'m going to ride some bikes.\"  He offered this message to his fans: \"I love you guys, I think you guys are awesome. Sorry for anybody who feels like disappointed or betrayed, that\\'s not in my heart or anything. And uh, have a blessed day!\" Then he gave a peace sign.  His manager Scott Braun also posted an Instagram, explaining Bieber ended the tour for his own well being. \"On behalf of myself, Justin, and the team, we are sorry,\" he wrote to the hurt fans. \"That was never our intent. But a man\\'s soul and well being I truly care about came first and We must all respect and honor that. Justin will be back and I know he looks forward to performing for you and with you all again. One chapter ends and another begins. Thank you again. \"  But! Australia\\'s Today Show had an interesting report of another reason Bieber ended the tour early. Apparently the Biebs, who famously attends Hillsong Church, has a \"Son of God\" tattoo across his chest, and was recently at Hillsong Conference with his friend Pastor Carl Lentz, wants to start his own church. An inside source told a reporter that the reason \"he came off the road is because he wants to reconnect with his faith, and he may be even planning to start his own church. We know that he was in the country [Australia] a few weeks ago having meetings and attending the big Hillsong convention that they had here. Very close to a lot of the Hillsong people. Whether he\\'s looking at teaming up with them or something of a more permanent situation or doing some sort of religious activity on his own, starting his own church, we\\'re not quite sure.\" ',\n \"Khloe Kardashian Shares Cute Photo With 'Precious' Niece Dream  Family time!

The singer shockingly ruptured her eardrum and was forced to cancel an April 27 concert in Las Vegas because of her medical emergency. This is so scary. Is Gwen\u2019s hearing going to be okay?   Gwen Stefani, 47, went through a terrifying ordeal on April 25 when her eardrum ruptured while on a flight. The painful injury landed Gwen in Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, where doctors told her not to fly anywhere or sing until it gets healed. The brutal injury came at exactly the wrong time for Gwen. She was supposed to sing at the Power f Love gala in Las Vegas just two days later.  The pop star/The Voice judge had to bow out of the prestigious event at the MGM Grand where she was set to perform a 30-minute live set, because of her limitations. That\u2019s so awful! Guests at the event, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, were told about the cancellation right before the event. Gwen recorded a short apology video that was played for the guests and gala honorees: \u201cI am so sorry that I cannot attend tonight, But I wanted to send a message of congratulations to Andre Agassi and my dear friend Ronald Pearlman,\u201d Gwen said.

She was still on The Voice this week and looked happy! A ruptured eardrum is no small deal, though. It occurs when a small perforation pops in the eardrum, sometimes from trauma, ear infection, loud noises, surgery, or flying in a plane with a severe cold. You know how your ears pop in a plane? It\u2019s like that, but way worse. It can lead to temporary hearing loss, or ringing in the ears.  It\u2019s unclear how severe Gwen\u2019s eardrum is injured, but the healing process can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, and in some very rare cases, years.

',\n 'Why Justin Timberlake Didn\u2019t Go to the Emmys With Jessica Biel  Jessica Biel stunned at the 2017 Emmy Awards in L.A. on Sunday, September 17, without her usual award show date, husband Justin Timberlake, by her side \u2014 and it turns out that the actress, 35, was riding solo for a very good reason.  Timberlake, 40, touched down in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to perform at Rock in Rio\u2019s show the same night. The singer headlined the event, which also featured performances from Alicia Keys, Walk the Moon and Frejat. Attendees at the annual concert series \u2014 which fundraises for social, environmental and cultural causes \u2014 also saw Maroon 5, Shawn Mendes, Fergie and more perform on previous nights.  Prior to the concert, Timberlake shared a series of behind-the-scenes photos with the caption: \u201cWe out here #RockInRio!\u201d  Meanwhile, Biel\u2019s night at the Emmys started on a rough note. On her way to the 69th annual ceremony, the actress revealed that the air conditioning in her car wasn\u2019t working. She captioned an Instagram post, in which she appears to be struggling through the heat, \u201cWhen the AC is broken en route to the Emmy\u2019s you thank God for the ice in your drank. #emmys.\u201d  While on the red carpet for the event, the actress \u2014 who stunned in a Ralph & Russo gown, Forevermark diamonds and Stuart Weitzman shoes \u2014 gushed over her and Timberlake\u2019s 2-year-old son Silas\u2019 latest milestones. \u201cNow he\u2019s saying to me, \u2018No, no, mommy.

For this week\u2019s issue, the actress spoke about women in Hollywood, shooting in New York for \u201cGossip Girl,\u201d and what she looks for in a role.  There\u2019s been a national conversation recently about gender disparity in Hollywood. Have you experienced that?    Yeah, I\u2019ve felt that. It\u2019s hard to complain when there are women who are being sex trafficked, women being treated as objects and product. Yes, it\u2019s important to have that conversation, because equality is equality. I feel fortunate. It\u2019s still to far from what it should be for women in 2017.  It\u2019s important to remember that half the audience of ticket buyers are female. Are you interested in doing tentpoles?   I don\u2019t look at movies by the budget. I look at movies by the character. What was neat about \u201cThe Shallows,\u201d it was really low budget. It was a $17 million movie and we did over $120 million worldwide. It\u2019s cool to do that with a story about a woman. It\u2019s proof people want to see movies about women. It doesn\u2019t all have to be Nicholas Sparks-type films. When you look at a \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise now versus the \u201cStar Wars\u201d franchise then, there are women at the center.  Do you think there could be a sequel to \u201cThe Shallows\u201d?   I don\u2019t know what would happen. I hope not; I\u2019m not ready to go work out like that again. I\u2019m about to do a movie in a couple months where I\u2019m playing a woman who is a fighter.  Have you started boxing?   I\u2019m not there yet. I\u2019m getting my back strong.  What speaks to you in a script?   I look for interesting women. It can be a woman in every frame of the movie or it could be a woman that\u2019s in one scene, but I look for characters that I connect with. Having a family and having worked on a show for six years, it really made me want to do work that I love. And it leads to greater success, which only means more opportunity to do that again.  Would you ever want to direct?    I\u2019m really drawn to it. I think I would do it later in life. It\u2019s two years and it becomes your baby. While my kids are young, I wouldn\u2019t want to do that.  Netflix has been rebooting old TV shows. Do you think they could ever do a \u201cGossip Girl\u201d reunion?   I don\u2019t know. Why not?  You\u2019d do a grown-up version with the cast?    It sort of all depends. Would I do seven years of the show? No, because it\u2019s hard work and I\u2019ve got my babies, and I don\u2019t want to be away from them that much. But I\u2019ve just learned in life you never say never. I\u2019m looking to do something that I haven\u2019t done yet, not something that I did. But would I do that? Who knows \u2014 if it was good, if it made sense. We had so much fun shooting and living and working in New York City.  The show glamorized Manhattan for a post-\u201cSex and the City\u201d generation.   Josh [Schwartz] and Stephanie [Savage] refused to do the show in Toronto. They said, \u201cNo, New York City is the star of the show.\u201d And so they fought for it to be made in New York. If we would have been in Toronto, I don\u2019t know if we would have made it past our first episode.  I can\u2019t imagine the show being set in a fake New York.   We were always in the coolest new spots. It was almost like a city guide as well as a fun show to watch. We were one of the first people to be at Sleep No More.  Would you go back to TV?   For me, it\u2019s about good content. My favorite new things I\u2019ve seen this year have been shows over movies, between \u201cThe OA\u201d and \u201cStranger Things.\u201d I finally watched all of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cWestworld.\u201d I love being an audience member of long-form story telling. I would only want to be in a show that I would want to watch. ',\n 'About That Time Princess Diana Watched The Golden Girls and Crashed a Gay Bar with Freddie Mercury  Princess Diana may have had more fun while married into the British royal family than we had originally thought. In her new book, British comedy actress Cleo Rocos says that she, Queen front man Freddie Mercury, and comedian Kenny Everett sneaked Princess Diana into a south-London gay bar, Royal Vauxhall Tavern, in the late 1980s. Rocos recalls the evening in The Power of Positive Drinking, writing that the trio dressed up the beloved late royal in disguise-an army jacket, cap, and sunglasses, according to an account of the story by the A.F.P.-and were able to enjoy themselves covertly thanks to Mercury\\'s popularity in the crowd:  She said she did not know whether Diana was propositioned in the bar in her guise as a male model, but added: \"She did look like a beautiful young man.\"  Rocos also claims that Diana enjoyed herself so much that she told the group, \"We must do it again!\" afterward. Amazingly, the undercover gay-bar excursion was not the only activity on the foursome\\'s agenda that day. Per Rocos\\'s recollections, the group spent the afternoon before the trip \"drinking champagne in front of reruns of The Golden Girls with the sound turned down\" and improvising show dialogue with \"a much naughtier storyline.\" After asking about the group\\'s plans that night, Diana, \"in full mischief mode,\" insisted on joining. Although Rocos and Everett tried to dissuade her, worried about unsavory headlines if she were detected by paparazzi, Mercury proved the deciding vote, telling them, \"Go on, let the girl have some fun.\"  Diana married into the royal family on July 29, 1981. ',\n 'Jennifer Aniston, Diva? Actress Rumored To Be \\'Unapproachable\\' On Set, Doesn\\'t Socialize (REPORT)  Could this former \"Friend\" be less than friendly in real life? Rumor has it that\\'s the case.  The word on Jennifer Aniston\\'s new movie set is that the 44-year-old doesn\\'t socialize with her co-stars and whenever possible distances herself in her remote trailer, RadarOnline exclusively reports.  \"Every day at lunch the entire cast and crew head to a cafeteria facility where they all sit down and eat lunch together for well over an hour,\" a source told RadarOnline. \"But the only person who doesn\\'t eat with everyone else is Jen. She quickly grabs a lunch to go and leaves.\"  According to RadarOnline\\'s source, Aniston also gets a fancier SUV than everyone else\\'s (including fellow stars Isla Fisher and Tim Robbins) and her trailer is situated way off set. All of these things make her seem \"not approachable,\" according to RadarOnline. But we can\\'t help but wonder ... Is she being a obnoxious, or is she really just trying to hide a pregnancy?  Think about it: Pregnancy gives you weird cravings but also nausea (hence the lonesome lunches), and perhaps she doesn\\'t want to undress in front of others who can catch a glimpse of her baby bump. Or maybe we\\'re just really, really wishful thinkers.  Either way, this is not the first time Aniston has had \"diva\" rumors attached to her. A year and a half ago she admitted to throwing a chair at a director (!) but for a worthy cause: The man treated the script supervisor poorly and Jen later explained she couldn\\'t stand aside and let him go on with it.

However, the Northern Irish actor confirmed that they now have a \"bond\" that will \"always be there\".  He said: \"We\\'ve been through a very unique situation that probably neither of us will ever go through again, that pushed us together and we had to rely on each other 100 per cent. It forged that bond between us that will always be there.  \"We didn\\'t know each other particularly on the first one because I was late to the party, and it meant there wasn\\'t a lot of time to form that friendship and that dynamic between us.  \"But working on this and Fifty Shades Freed [the next film] was so much better in that sense because we had gotten to know each other so well, become best friends, knew what to expect of the other - especially when you\\'re shooting scenes of very close intimacy.\"  On the sex scenes, he added to Heat: \"It was easier to do the sex scenes with someone you know well. There were glimpses of awkwardness in the first, but that was completely eradicated by the second.   \"We both got to learn that each of us go for the joke when things get a little too intense, or bashful, it\\'s our natural reaction.\"  The movie has performed strongly at the box office despite swathes of negative reviews.  Dornan and Johnson also recently revealed that one particularly steamy sex sequence - set on a pool table - was cut.  The film has had an odd impact on cinemas around the world: in France last week, a man was arrested in France for masturbating in a screening.  In a remarkable coincidence, he had not realised he was sitting next to military police officers.',\n \"J-Rod!

Despite the surreal fame\u2014and baggage\u2014carried by Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez, their relationship makes perfect sense. Both started from modest backgrounds, hit the big time fast, and had to battle their own demons to survive. The new couple discuss everything from their nerve-racking first date to the \u201creveals\u201d that forged their bond.  \u2018It was just one of those things where you feel compelled to do something you wouldn\u2019t normally do,\u201d says Jennifer Lopez, explaining how she and retired Yankee superstar Alex Rodriguez, who made their red-carpet debut as a couple last spring at the Met Gala, came to be a modern Marilyn Monroe and Joe DiMaggio\u2014that is, if Monroe and DiMaggio had been happy, highly functional fortysomethings who had apparently done battle with their demons and emerged the victors. It was last winter as she was having lunch in Beverly Hills that she saw Rodriguez walk by. \u201cI almost yelled out \u2018Alex,\u2019 but I am the shyest person when it comes to things like that,\u201d she says. When she went outside, he was still there, facing away from her. \u201cI could literally just have walked away,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I walk over and tap him on the shoulder and say \u2018Hey.\u2019 \u201cI had just come from a promo for my show, Shades of Blue [in which she plays N.Y.P.D. detective Harlee Santos], so I\u2019m dressed like my character, like a boy\u2014Timberlands, jeans, curly short hair. He looks at me. I say, \u2018It\u2019s Jennifer.\u2019 He says, \u2018You look so beautiful.\u2019 \u201d She and I are sitting on a stone patio at Lopez\u2019s new house in Bel Air, overlooking an infinity pool and a lush green lawn with a double-size swing, which she points out is perfect for her nine-year-old twins, Emme and Max. The house is light-filled, sprawling, and warm, with wood-beamed ceilings, stone walls, plush low-slung sofas, big pillows, bowls filled with cut roses, and artwork by collagist Peter Tunney. \u201cGRATTITUD\u018e,\u201d one piece spells out. It\u2019s a portmanteau of \u201cgratitude\u201d and \u201cattitude\u201d that could define Lopez. Wearing a cropped turtleneck sweater, skinny jeans, high Christian Louboutin boots, and impressive diamond earrings, she is as startlingly beautiful at 48 as she was at 28\u2014if not more so. \u201cWe walked into this house, and I said, \u2018This is where I want my kids to grow up,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cYou have to imagine your life, and what you want to be in it, and I imagined we would be very happy here no matter what.\u201d  Happy, naturally, has turned out differently from what she imagined. Just hours after Rodriguez met her in Beverly Hills, he called her, and they agreed to have dinner a few nights later. She told him that she remembered meeting him on a baseball diamond, 12 years earlier. Her then husband, Marc Anthony, had thrown out the first pitch of a New York Mets game, but the cameras captured Lopez and Rodriguez shaking hands and locking eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say you remember if you don\u2019t,\u201d she told him. \u201cShea Stadium, during a subway series,\u201d he responded. Just then, Rodriguez walks out of the house to join us on the patio. \u201cI was telling her about the tap,\u201d she says to him. \u201cBut there were two taps,\u201d he says. She turns to me. \u201cThere was another very significant tap on the shoulder,\u201d she says. Before we get to that tap, we talk about their first date, when they met for dinner at the Hotel Bel Air. \u201cHe was sitting there in his white shirt, very confident and manly, but then he was just so talkative!\u201d she says. \u201cI think he thought I was going to be this loud person, but I\u2019m not. I just listen. So he\u2019s talking, talking about his plans, about how he had just retired from baseball, about how he saw himself getting married again, all these things you wouldn\u2019t normally talk about on a first date. I don\u2019t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date. Then I knew he was nervous because he asked me if I wanted a drink. I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t drink,\u2019 and he asked if I minded if he had one. He was nervous, and it was really cute.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know if it was a date,\u201d Rodriguez says. \u201cMaybe we were seeing each other at night because of her work schedule. I went in uneasy, not knowing her situation.\u201d He continues: \u201cIt would be incredibly productive for me to sit with one of the smartest, greatest women in the world, especially for a guy like me who is coming through tough times, rehabbing himself, re-establishing himself to folks out there. I thought it would be a win-win no matter what.\u201d Then: \u201cShe told me around the third or fourth inning that she was single,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to get up and go re-adjust my thoughts. I went to the bathroom and got enough courage to send her a text.\u201d \u201cSo I\u2019m sitting there and he\u2019s walking back, and I get a text,\u201d Lopez continues. \u201cIt says . . . \u201d She looks significantly at Rodriguez. \u201cYou can tell her!\u201d he says. \u201c \u2018You look sexy AF,\u2019 \u201d she tells me. They both laugh. \u201cAnd then it took a turn,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cThe fire alarm went off, and we had to evacuate.\u201d I laugh, thinking she\u2019s being metaphorical. \u201cNo, really,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fire alarm went off!\u201d  But about that other tap. This one was metaphorical. In August 2016, when Rodriguez announced his retirement from baseball, with his mother and his daughters Natasha and Ella in the stands, four runs short of 700 home runs, he said, \u201cBaseball has a funny way of tapping you on the shoulder when you least expect it and telling you that it\u2019s the end.\u201d It\u2019s a year later, and now, he says, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about one door closing and another opening, and if that first door doesn\u2019t close, well, there isn\u2019t that second tap.\u201d Rodriguez\u2019s story about the tap is a poignant reminder that this isn\u2019t just another love story. It\u2019s the story of two people with rich and at times tumultuous pasts, which are part of the reason they have a present as a couple. \u201cWe are very much twins,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re both Leos; we\u2019re both from New York; we\u2019re both Latino and about 20 other things.\u201d \u201cI understand him in a way that I don\u2019t think anyone else could, and he understands me in a way that no one else could ever,\u201d she says. \u201cIn his 20s, he came into big success with the biggest baseball contract [at the time]. I had a No. 1 movie and a No. 1 album and made history. We both had ups and downs and challenges in our 30s, and by our 40s we\u2019d both been through so much. And more importantly than anything, we had both done a lot of work on ourselves.\u201d Lopez, whose parents came from Puerto Rico, grew up in the Bronx, where she shared a bedroom with her two sisters. She famously left home at 18 to make it as a dancer, and burst on the scene in 1991 as one of the Fly Girls on Fox\u2019s In Living Color, the hit comedy series. She quickly parlayed her luminous beauty, talent, and sheer workaholism into a series of starring roles, including Marisa in Maid in Manhattan, which grossed more than $150 million worldwide. Of their first date Lopez recalls, \u201cI don\u2019t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date. . . . He was nervous, and it was really cute.\u201d Being a movie star wasn\u2019t enough for Lopez. She also released a string of hit albums and became a fashion icon. In 2003, she signed a lucrative endorsement deal with Louis Vuitton. \u201cNow it\u2019s odd if you\u2019re a celebrity and you don\u2019t serve as the spokesperson for a brand,\u201d says Benny Medina, her longtime manager, whom Lopez credits with seeing the potential of celebrities as brands long before it was commonplace. \u201cBut back then there were plenty of snarky comments.\u201d In 2013, Lopez was granted a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and the following year she became the first female artist to receive a Billboard Icon Award; her net worth has been estimated at more than $300 million. \u201cThere are people who put their feet in other people\u2019s footsteps,\u201d says Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, who was once Lopez\u2019s agent and is now a partner in her production company. \u201cJennifer had no footsteps in front of her, so much of the terrain had to be forged.\u201d  There was a cost, Lopez learned. \u201cWhen you have that type of success at a young age you have to navigate it, almost survive it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the first Latin actress to ever make $1 million from a role, and you feel, Oh God, I have to do something great all the time.\u201d There were the inevitable flops (most prominently Gigli, her movie with then boyfriend Ben Affleck) and three failed marriages, the last of which was with Marc Anthony, the father of her twins. And so her story isn\u2019t just about astounding achievement but also about personal growth and resilience. \u201cI was eviscerated,\u201d she recalls about the press on Gigli. \u201cI lost my sense of self, questioned if I belonged in this business, thought maybe I did suck at everything. And my relationship [with Affleck] self-destructed in front of the entire world. It was a two-year thing for me until I picked myself up again.\u201d She has also conquered what was once her biggest fear: being alone. Last August, she broke up with dancer Casper Smart in an effort to learn how. \u201cShe\u2019s a seeker,\u201d says her close friend Leah Remini, the actress and anti-Scientology activist. \u201cShe\u2019s always trying to improve herself, her relationships, be a better friend, a better daughter, a better mother, a better person. She\u2019s not closed-minded.\u201d If self-doubt and self-reflection aren\u2019t what you\u2019d expect from a diva, it\u2019s striking how little diva there is to Lopez these days. Goldsmith-Thomas, who, in 2004, was diagnosed with Stage Three breast cancer, recalls that Lopez would show up for her chemo appointments. \u201cShe made me very popular on the chemo ward!,\u201d Goldsmith says. \u201cShe\u2019d bring clothing for everyone from her Sweetface line and she\u2019d rub my bald head and talk about dreams. It was really important to talk about the future because she wanted me to know there was one. That girl saved my life.\u201d Rodriguez tells me that Lopez is happiest at home, in pj\u2019s, eating chocolate-chip cookies with friends. She and Rodriguez like to talk in terms of \u201creveals\u201d: the unexpected moments that tell you who someone else is. An early one for him, he says, was discovering that Lopez was \u201cthe role model for health and wellness. She rarely drinks. She tries to get at least eight hours of sleep.\u201d He adds, \u201cThat helps explain why she\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d She\u2019s also been willing to take risks to stay relevant, no easy task in a world where female stars are widely believed to have an expiration date. In 2010, she agreed to become a judge on American Idol, which some people derided as a comedown. But it worked. \u201cViewers who knew only an attention-grabbing siren met a hardworking, self-made, empathetic single mother,\u201d observed Forbes. \u201cNo one from my team wanted me to do American Idol except Benny,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cBut I felt I had something to offer, and in the back of my mind, I thought, Maybe people will get to know me a little bit better.\u201d She adds, \u201cWith reality TV, you can\u2019t hide who you are. You just can\u2019t. It\u2019s going to come through.\u201d  As Lopez was becoming J.Lo, so Alex Rodriguez was becoming A-Rod. He was just 18 and the youngest player in the league when he made his debut with the Mariners, in July 1994. He turned in a series of impressive stats that galvanized the baseball world\u2014like becoming the youngest player to hit 500 home runs. For the 2001 season, he was offered a record-breaking 10-year $252 million contract by the Texas Rangers. In 2004, Rodriguez was traded to the New York Yankees, and in 2007 he negotiated another 10-year deal. Like Lopez, Rodriguez is not a child of privilege. He too was born in New York City. When Alex was eight, his parents, immigrants from the Dominican Republic, moved the family to Miami, where his mother became a secretary in an immigration office and waited tables at night. When he was 10, his dad moved out of the house. As with Lopez, success made him feel not comfort and security but a near-desperate drive to succeed even more. (And you can see how questions such as CAN ALEX RODRIGUEZ PROVE HE\u2019S WORTH $252 MILLION? would foster that attitude in a young athlete.) \u201cMy No. 1 goal was to give R.O.I. [return on investment] to owners who believed in me,\u201d he recalls. In 2008, his marriage to Cynthia Scurtis, with whom he had daughters Natasha and Ella, broke up, due to his relationship with Madonna, and his dates with stars from Kate Hudson to Cameron Diaz became tabloid fodder. Plus, there were the injuries: two major hip surgeries, two knee surgeries. \u201cWe\u2019re both like this,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cWe put so much pressure on ourselves to be great, to be the best all the time. We understood that about each other. When we came together it was \u2018Oh my God, I was the same way.\u2019 \u201d  Rodriguez\u2019s career was ultimately sidelined by the steroid scandal, which rocked Major League Baseball in the mid-2000s. Rodriguez had earlier admitted using performance-enhancing drugs during his time with the Rangers, but adamantly denied he\u2019d continued the practice while with the Yankees. After a protracted fight with both the Yankees and the M.L.B., Rodriguez was suspended for an entire season\u2014one of the largest penalties in baseball history\u2014in early 2014. \u201cI was hoping the suspension would be shorter,\u201d he says today. \u201cI remember when Tony Clark, the head of our union, called me and said, \u2018It\u2019s a full season\u2014it\u2019s 162 [games],\u2019 it was a knife to my ribs.\u201d Rodriguez says he didn\u2019t leave his house for seven days. \u201cI thought I\u2019d played my last game. I grew a beard\u2014as much as I can grow it\u2014and didn\u2019t want to see anyone, including my kids.\u201d I ask him what he learned during that year. \u201cDo you have enough time?\u201d he asks. As he talks, Lopez nestles into him. \u201cI started brushing myself off, thinking, How do I come back into the world?\u201d he says. The year off, he realized, could give him the chance to heal not just his body but also his mind. \u201cI felt I could work on myself, understand why I kept making mistakes. . . . In a weird way, 2014 will be the best thing that ever happened to me. It forced a paradigm shift.\u201d He continues: \u201cI remember thinking one night . . . Don\u2019t know if I told you this, babe [he says to Lopez] . . . In the middle of this craziness, I remember it\u2019s three A.M., four A.M., and like many nights, I couldn\u2019t sleep. I\u2019m not a crier, but I\u2019m bawling. . . . My pillows are now soaking wet, and it\u2019s the middle of the night, and I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m the only fucking asshole that gets pocket aces and figures out a way to lose the hand. I was so angry at myself, so pissed off, that it was hard to breathe.\u201d \u201cHow did you get through?\u201d I ask. \u201cHelp,\u201d he says. \u201cThe work I did, that was one of the most painful and most rewarding experiences of my life, and it continues to this day. I tell myself, \u2018I\u2019m rounding first base and going to second base. It\u2019s a process.\u2019 \u201d He says he decided to do like Rocky Balboa, to try to make the team \u201cas a broken-down 40-year-old that didn\u2019t have a lot of allies.\u201d And he succeeded, finishing the season with 33 home runs. \u201cI did that at 40 and 100 percent clean, and no one can take that away from me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt told me everything about who I was.\u201d When he retired, he agreed to stay on as an adviser to Yankee owner Hal Steinbrenner and as a mentor to younger players. \u201cFrom where I came from, that honor is like hitting 800,\u201d he says. This, to Lopez, was a reveal. \u201cThe most impressive thing to me was how he did pick himself up and take that opportunity to make himself a better person,\u201d she says. \u201cThe hardest times prove who you are. That\u2019s what I love and admire the most about Alex. He doesn\u2019t let anything beat him. He just comes back stronger.\u201d Each believes that if they had been single when they met, 12 years ago, the relationship wouldn\u2019t have worked. \u201cWe had to grow and discover ourselves first,\u201d she says. But it also works for another reason. As Goldsmith-Thomas says, \u201cThey weren\u2019t afraid to dream, and they are still dreaming, both of them.\u201d  The next night, Lopez is performing her smash show All I Have in Las Vegas. Onstage, she moves seamlessly from the best kind of sexy\u2014with a sense of humor\u2014to a festive Latin-inspired segment, to an utterly moving testimonial to her children, in which she sings Lee Ann Womack\u2019s \u201cI Hope You Dance.\u201d She\u2019s an incandescent performer, partly because, as Remini says, \u201cthere is nothing Jennifer does that she does half-assed. When she is in a project, she is in it, devouring it.\u201d \u201cA-Rod\u2019s in the house,\u201d someone from the audience yells. She laughs. Yes, A-Rod is in the house. Although he\u2019s seen the show many times, he\u2019s still watching every detail. He nudges me, pointing out a middle-aged woman in a pink pantsuit dancing ecstatically to \u201cJenny from the Block.\u201d Then he points out a gay couple in the front row practically swooning after one gets to touch Lopez\u2019s feet. During a segment that\u2019s all New York, with Lopez in a sequined baseball jersey, he nudges me again. \u201cIf you look closely, you\u2019ll see what number she\u2019s wearing on her jersey,\u201d he says. It\u2019s 13, his Yankee number. He says, \u201cWe are very much twins.\u201d She says, \u201cI understand him in a way that I don\u2019t think anyone else could.\u201d Earlier that day, she and Rodriguez were in Los Angeles at the premiere event for this season\u2019s Shark Tank, in which Rodriguez will be the first Latino shark. At a panel where the sharks discussed the show, the investor and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban says, \u201cA lot of us were pleasantly surprised that when Alex came in, he knew his stuff cold.\u201d During the red-carpet interviews, Lopez, who is impossibly glamorous in a floor-length tweed coat and aviator sunglasses, hangs at the back of the crowd. \u201cDoes it feel weird to be in the background?\u201d I ask. \u201cNoooo,\u201d she says. \u201cI like it. Because I\u2019m out there enough. Some people, it wouldn\u2019t work\u2014they can\u2019t stand not being the one in the spotlight. But not us.\u201d  Their story is also a merger of business empires. Lopez, who back in 2002\u2014way before everyone else was becoming an entrepreneur\u2014launched her fragrance Glow by J.Lo, now has a big portfolio of business interests, which range from her production company to sprawling property holdings. Rodriguez seems to slot right into her world. From a young age, he sought out mentors who could help him build a business that would one day replace his baseball income. During his suspension year, he took investing classes at Columbia and marketing classes at the University of Miami. Today, A-Rod Corp is an investment firm focused on a broad array of industries, including real estate, sports and wellness, media, and entertainment. \u201cI don\u2019t have your traditional formal education,\u201d he says. \u201cMine comes through reading and passion and grit and collecting a lot of information from my mentors. I\u2019ve never been afraid to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know. Can you explain that to me?\u2019 That\u2019s echoed by hedge-fund billionaire Marc Lasry, who has invested with Rodriguez for the last decade. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting about Alex is that he\u2019s a sponge,\u201d Lasry says. \u201cHe really wants to learn.\u201d Another mentor of sorts is Mary Callahan Erdoes, the C.E.O. of J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management, who met Rodriguez around the time that Lasry did. \u201cYou might be expecting something different,\u201d she says. \u201cBut from the first day, he had his notebook out. He\u2019s incredibly curious and serious. There\u2019s no nonsense and no pomp and circumstance.\u201d That\u2019s true to this day, Erdoes says, whether he\u2019s attending a JPMorgan-hosted conference on Brexit or a meeting with a hedge-fund manager. \u201cHe sits in the front of the room with his notebook out and his hand up, asking questions,\u201d she says. Rodriguez\u2019s innate curiosity\u2014about business, about other people, about fresh concepts\u2014makes him stand out in a world where many people lack that trait. \u201cThe real reason people do deals with Alex is that they like him and he\u2019s smart,\u201d says Lasry.  The day after I saw Lopez\u2019s show in Las Vegas, we meet at one of Rodriguez\u2019s latest investments, which he discovered when he was looking for a place to work out in Las Vegas\u2014members of Lopez\u2019s crew had raved about it. Called TruFusion, it offers more than 65 styles of instruction and 35 to 40 daily classes in yoga, Pilates, kettlebell exercises, and battle-rope workouts in heated rooms. Last June, Rodriguez purchased a major stake in the company, and now owns the development rights for all of Florida. President and C.O.O. Jonathan Fornaci says the classes can be so hard that he sees some professional athletes take breaks during them, but \u201cAlex kills it. And immediately afterward he\u2019s drilling down, asking questions that any private-equity analyst would be asking.\u201d I\u2019m warned that the \u201cDown N Dirty Bootcamp\u201d will be hard and sweaty, and it is precisely as advertised. At one point, confused by the welter of instructions\u2014Left! Right! Kettlebell! Weight! Sandbag!\u2014I look over at Lopez and roll my eyes in desperation. \u201cI get confused, too,\u201d she says. \u201cJust watch everyone else.\u201d During some particularly brutal leg lifts, I give up. She does not. In fact, she starts singing. At the end, we\u2019re all sitting on our mats, drenched in sweat and exhausted. Journey\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u201d\u2019 is playing.  It\u2019s clear as day that neither of them is hitting Pause. After Vegas, she\u2019s off to New York, where her children are in school, and he\u2019s off to Atlanta, where he\u2019s filming a pilot for a CNBC reality show that will help retired athletes who are struggling financially. Rodriguez says he keeps himself grounded with some key words: \u201cGratitude and appreciation. When someone offers me a job, I thank the Lord that I have work, and I beg for more work.\u201d And he adds, \u201cWe\u2019re really good at reminding each other.\u201d They begin to tell me a story, one in which Lopez is in the bath, and Rodriguez is sitting by the fire in a robe. Looking at my face, he starts laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re like, \u2018Where are you going with this story, and is it going to get R-rated?\u2019 \u201d But it\u2019s not R-rated, not at all. He says he got hot from the fire and went to sit on the patio outside their room, with a book and his feet up, in the crisp air. Lopez breaks in. \u201cI came out and said, \u2018What are you doing out here?\u2019 He said, \u2018Living the dream.\u2019 \u201d It\u2019s clear from the story that he said it in a way that was free of irony. \u201cI thought, Wow, this person is different,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cBecause a lot of people I\u2019ve met in my life, they don\u2019t appreciate what they\u2019re doing and how amazing it is . . . not the greatness of the house, but the moment of sitting there with someone you love, with a family, with healthy kids.\u201d All over the house are pictures of their four children as one family; when I ask Rodriguez which of his businesses he\u2019s most passionate about, he responds, without missing a beat, \u201cMy daughters.\u201d  As we drive from TruFusion to a little restaurant in a Vegas strip mall called Greens and Proteins, they say that early in their relationship they\u2019d text each other using the hashtag #bloodinbloodout, after the Mexican gangster film that is in some ways about the unbreakable ties of family. At the restaurant, a few people turn and stare, but mostly we\u2019re ignored, probably because no one can quite believe it\u2019s them. He\u2019s in workout clothes; she\u2019s wearing a cropped pink sweatshirt, no makeup, and has her hair pulled back in a bun. When we sit down, Rodriguez asks what surprised me the most about spending time with them. I answer that I was surprised, even shocked, by their genuine interest in other people. But when I walked behind them as they left TruFusion, their hands were touching and they were talking intently. It was normal and natural and easy. And that\u2019s an even better answer: I\u2019m most surprised to see that, out of two often surreal lives, they are managing to make one wonderfully real life. Our essential brief on culture, the news, and more. And it's on the house. \",\n 'Lady Gaga is not pregnant, says representative   LOS ANGELES: Lady Gaga \\'s representative has denied reports that the singer is pregnant The rumours were sparked after Gaga was seen sporting what appeared to be a baby bump last week.

A recent report of the young stars hanging out has definitely given rise to hope among many in their strong fan bases that the former couple could get back together. Bieber and Gomez were off-and-on for several years before finally calling it quits in 2014. TMZ recently reported that the singers hung out together, with friends, at Gomez\\'s Studio City, California, home. Enter the return of #Jelena. Social media has been filled with fans expressing delight that Bieber, 23, and Gomez, 25, appear to be back on good terms.  For the record, exes can be friends and there has been no word that Gomez has split from her most recent love, singer The Weeknd. In 2015, Bieber told Complex magazine that he and Gomez had their identities invested in each other when they were a couple (the pair briefly lived together when Bieber was 18.) \"When stuff would happen, I would lose my freakin\\' mind, and she would lose her mind, and we would fight so hard because we were so invested in each other,\" he said. The both have had kind things to say about each other over the years, most recently with Gomez complimenting Bieber\\'s performance in June at Ariana Grande\\'s One Love Manchester benefit concert to aid victims of the terrorist attack.  ',\n 'George, Amal Clooney donate $1M to Southern Poverty Law Center to combat hate groups  If money talks, George and Amal Clooney made it shout Tuesday, by donating $1 million to the Southern Poverty Law Center to help fight hate groups in the wake of tragedy and violence in Charlottesville, Va.  The SPLC, a leading civil-rights group that monitors hate groups and campaigns against bigotry,\\xa0is partnering with the Clooney Foundation for Justice to increase its ability to combat hate groups in the USA by highlighting the dangers of white-supremacist ideology.  The SPLC said further details on what the money will be used for will be available later.  \"Amal and I wanted to add our voice (and financial assistance) to the ongoing fight for equality,\" Clooney said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"There are no two sides to bigotry and hate.\u201d  The latter comment was an allusion to President Trump\\'s much-criticized assertions last week that neo-Nazis and white supremacists and anti-fascist counter-protesters who confronted them in Charlottesville were equally culpable for the violence that led to three deaths on the weekend of Aug. 11-12. Trump said there are \"fine people\" on \"both sides.\"  \"We are proud to support the Southern Poverty Law Center in its efforts to prevent violent extremism in the United States,\" the Clooneys said in their prepared statement. \"What happened in Charlottesville, and what is happening in communities across our country, demands our collective engagement to stand up to hate.\"  Since Charlottesville, the center also has received major donations from Apple and from JPMorgan Chase, whose leaders \u2014\\xa0Tim Cook\\xa0at Apple and Jamie Dimon\\xa0at JPMorgan Chase\\xa0\u2014 both spoke out on the need for America\\'s leading business and cultural institutions to take stands against bigotry and hate.  George Clooney was a supporter of Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign and is well-known as a leading Hollywood liberal. His wife, Amal Alamuddin,\\xa0is a Lebanese-born British lawyer known for her human-rights legal work around the world.  The Clooneys founded and serve as presidents of the Clooney Foundation for Justice, established in 2016\\xa0\"to advance justice in courtrooms, classrooms and communities\" around the world.  SPLC president\\xa0Richard Cohen \\xa0said hate-group monitors were \"shocked by the size, ugliness and ferocity\" of the white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville.  \u201cIt was a reflection of just how much Trump\u2019s incendiary campaign and presidency has energized the radical right,\" Cohen said. \"We are deeply grateful to the Clooney Foundation for standing with us at this critical moment in our country\u2019s fight against hate.\u201d ',\n 'What Cher Actually Eats in a Day to Stay So Unbelievably Fit  At the Billboard Music Awards, Cher took the stage to perform two of her greatest hits, and we were amazed by how incredible the Billboard Icon Award recipient looks at age 71.  During her set, the singer revealed that she can hold a five-minute plank. \"Icon\" is right.  We did some digging to find out what the singing legend actually does in a day to stay so toned. We want all of her secrets to healthy aging and how she can hold a plank position for five minutes straight (something us mere mortals can\\'t seem to master longer than a minute, err, fine, 30 seconds).  As she told her Twitter followers, she doesn\\'t eat ham or red meat, and focuses on eating veggie alternatives instead.  \"I don\\'t like meat and so most of things that I like are healthy for you,\" told Hello! in 2013.  In addition to her vegetarian diet, Cher knows the importance of being healthy, and so, she\\'ll rarely drink and never does drugs.  \"Being healthy has always been part of my life. It just works for me,\" she told Closer in 2013. \"There are things I don\\'t like that are unhealthy, like drugs and drinking, so I never got into them to begin with. I smoked cigarettes for a while and I\\'d have done drugs had I liked them, but they didn\\'t agree with me. I\\'ll only drink three of four times a year too.\"  To keep her body in such amazing shape, the singer knows that certain things are better for your, and so, she sticks to those with nutritional benefits.  \"I try to avoid foods with a high fat content because they make me sluggish and keep my weight up,\" Cher wrote in her 1991 book, Forever Fit. \"Dairy products are not good for us. I weaned myself from whole milk to nonfat milk \u2014 if I\\'m having milk at all. I think cheese is one of the worst things for the body. It doesn\\'t digest well, and most cheeses are too high in fat and cholesterol.\"  It\\'s clearly worked for the 71-year-old star!  Cher admits that sometimes on film sets, she\\'s binged on unhealthy treats from craft services. We can relate!  \"I have had some bad binges while making movies. At the end of The Witches of Eastwick, Michelle Pfeiffer, Susan Sarandon and I really went crazy. We\\'d go from one of our trailers to the other stuffing ourselves with Pepperidge Farm Cheddar Cheese Goldfish, M&Ms, Cokes and Hershey\\'s Kisses,\" she wrote. \"Then Michelle and I found out we could microwave sweet potatoes in four minutes, and that changed our entire lives. We lived on sweet potatoes, baked potatoes and Caesar salads.\" ',\n 'Gwen Stefani is returning to \\'The Voice,\\' but what about Miley Cyrus?   Gwen Stefani is all set to return to the hot seat on \"The Voice,\" but whose chair is she snatching?  NBC announced Tuesday that Stefani would rejoin the judge\\'s panel in February\\xa0for Season 12 of the reality singing competition, taking the place of current judge Miley Cyrus.  Stefani, who previously served as a judge on seasons seven and nine, will be seated alongside relative newcomer Alicia Keys, who joined the show in Season 11 (currently airing), as well as original judges Adam Levine and Blake Shelton.  \"We can\\'t wait to experience the unique chemistry and energy Gwen, Alicia, Blake and Adam will bring to season 12,\" said Paul Telegdy, president of NBC Entertainment\\'s\\xa0alternative and reality group, in a statement released Tuesday morning.

To be fair, if we had a 3.5-carat, custom-designed Neil Lane engagement ring we would never take it off.  It was back in April 2016, the pair were spotted out together for the first time...  When we first heard the news that old flames Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth were back together after splitting back in 2013, we were thrilled.  An insider told E News! at the time that Liam\\'s family is pleased to have Miley back in their life, and think that they can make it work now that they\\'re older.  \"Liam never stopped loving Miley. Liam and Miley\\'s timing was just off the first time they were engaged, many things played into them calling it off,\" an insider told the website.  \"They both needed to grow up and figure themselves out more.  \"Liam\\'s family... always liked Miley but they supported Liam\\'s decision at the time. They did feel that both of them were too young.\"  The source added, \"They are in love and it\\'s a different time now for them.\"  Back in 2015, when the pair had broken up, Liam opened up about his five year relationship with Miley saying his feelings for her will never change.  When asked if he felt like he\\'d \"dodged a bullet,\" he said: \"You fall in love with who you fall in love with; you can never choose. I guess some people just come with a little more baggage.  \"I mean, look-we were together five years, so I don\\'t think those feelings will ever change. And that\\'s good because that proves to me that it was real. It wasn\\'t just a fling. It really was an important part of my life and always will be,\" he told Men\\'s Fitness.   He continued: \"She\\'s a free spirit. I think she\\'ll always surprise people with what she does, but she\\'s not a malicious person in any way. She\\'s a young girl who wants to do what she wants to do.\"  Likewise, Miley told Australian talk show host Chris Bath: \"I love Liam, Liam loves me\".  ',\n 'Tom Hiddleston speaks out about Taylor Swift relationship: \\'Of course it was real\\'  The silence on Hiddleswift has been broken\\xa0\u2013 from Tom Hiddleston\\'s side, at least.  The Olivier and Golden Globe Award-winning actor has spoken about his brief relationship with pop star Taylor Swift for the first time since the pair broke up in September 2016, and has insisted that their liaison wasn\\'t a stunt.  \"Of course it was real\", Hiddleston told GQ magazine when asked about the validity of their relationship.  \"Taylor is an amazing woman. She\u2019s generous and kind and lovely, and we had the best time,\" he added.

Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron revealed that they both brought their kids to work while they were filming The Huntsman: Winter\u2019s War, and it totally changed the dynamics of the set.  \u201cThere was a whole difference of energy on this because we all had our kids there on set a lot of the time,\u201d the 32-year-old Aussie actor, who is reprising his role as the Huntsman, said during a press conference for the sequel to Snow White & the Huntsman. \u201cNormally, the set being this sort of tense, respectful, quiet sort of place.

Their fellow costar Emily Blunt, who is currently pregnant with her second child, didn\u2019t chime in about whether she let Hazel, her 2-year-old daughter with husband John Krasinski, run around on set, but she did say she left the fight sequences to the kids. \u201cCharlize and I spent our time hobbling around in high heels going, \u2018My feet hurt,\u2019\u201d recalled the actress, who plays rival sister Freya to Theron\u2019s Queen Ravenna. \u201cThat was, like, the extent of our actions \u2026 [costar] Jessica [Chastain] would, like, come into the makeup bus just pouring with sweat from some awful stunt coordinating.\u201d  The Huntsman: Winter\u2019s War is directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan and hits theaters on April 22, 2016.  \",\n 'Jane Fonda really didn\\'t want to talk about plastic surgery with Megyn Kelly  Fonda appeared with Robert Redford on \"Megyn Kelly Today\" on Wedesnday to promote their new film, \"Our Souls at Night.\" But the interview took a turn mere minutes in as Kelly turned the conversation with the two legends to the subject of aging.  \"You\\'ve been an example to everyone in how to age beautifully and with strength and unapologetically,\" Kelly told Fonda to applause. \"You admit you\\'ve had work done, which I think is to your credit.

In a Monday interview with the cast and creators of \"Will & Grace,\" Kelly brought a male fan to meet the cast and asked him, \"Is it true you became a lawyer -- and you became gay -- becomes of Will?\" On top of drawing criticism, the question prompted backlash from \"Will & Grace\" star Debra Messing. On Instagram, the actress was asked by a commenter, \"But why did you guys do the Megyn Kelly show? That\\'s a fail!!\" Messing responded, claiming she didn\\'t know she was doing Kelly\\'s show until Monday morning. \"The itinerary just said Today Show appearance. Regret going on,\" she wrote. \"Dismayed by her comments.\" Kelly\\'s other guests this week have included Rumer Willis and the cast of \"This Is Us.\" ',\n 'Robert Pattinson: \\'Twilight\\'s the hardest part I\\'ve done\\'  He made his name as teenage vampire heart-throb Edward Cullen in Twilight. Then his turbulent romance with co\u2011star Kristen Stewart dominated the world\\'s gossip columns. Now Robert Pattinson is older, wiser and shedding his Hollywood pretty-boy image. He talks about his new role in David Mich\u00f4d\\'s dystopian outback western The Rover   There is a moment in The Rover, David Mich\u00f4d\\'s futuristic western set in the Australian outback, in which Robert Pattinson\\'s character sits in the cab of a truck at night listening to the radio play Keri Hilson\\'s hit Pretty Girl Rock. The night is black and the radio tinny, and softly Pattinson begins to sing along. \"Don\\'t hate me \\'cause I\\'m beautiful,\" he sings, his voice high and whiny, the lyrics muffled by lips that cling to dirty teeth. \"Don\\'t hate me \\'cause I\\'m beautiful.\"  It\\'s a pivotal moment for Rey, the slow, needy, uncertain young man Pattinson plays, but it also feels like something of a reference point in the career of the actor himself; a small reminder for the audience of just how far he has run from his days as the pretty-boy Hollywood pin-up.  The Pattinson who walks into our interview this morning seems to play a similar trick, pointing out, two steps into the room, that the hotel carpet \"looks like a Magic Eye picture\". And indeed it does \u2013 a bold, blurry pattern in stripes of cream and black. But Pattinson\\'s remark also serves to shifts attention neatly away from himself, as if he is weary of being the centre of it, the face that everyone stares at.  Pattinson was 22 when he was first cast as Edward Cullen in the Twilight Saga, the five-part movie adaptation of Stephanie Meyer\\'s best-selling teen vampire novels. Overnight he became one of Hollywood\\'s most adored young stars, pursued wherever he went by paparazzi and screaming fans. He was named \"the most handsome man in the world\" by Vanity Fair, and one of the 100 Most Influential People by Time. Amid all the fuss and the madness he embarked upon a tortuous relationship with his co-star, Kristen Stewart, that meant the young couple were rarely out of the gossip pages.  He is 28 now. The final Twilight instalment done, the Stewart romance finished, he is finally cutting a dash as a serious actor.  Early leading-man roles (Remember Me; Water for Elephants) have given way to more challenging characters \u2013 he earned impressive reviews for his portrayal of a young billionaire in David Cronenberg\\'s adaptation of Don DeLillo\\'s Cosmopolis, and will soon be seen in another Cronenberg project, Maps to the Stars \u2013 as well as starring alongside Nicole Kidman in the Gertrude Bell biopic Queen of the Desert.  But for now he is rooted in Mich\u00f4d\\'s The Rover, a brilliantly dark story of a loner (Guy Pearce) in pursuit of a gang of ramshackle crooks who have stolen his car. En route, he acquires Rey (Pattinson), the brother of one of the thieves, whom they had left for dead at the scene of a botched robbery, and together they chug through the Australian desert, now a glowering, lawless land 10 years after a global economic collapse.  \"I just thought it was strikingly original,\" Pattinson says of first reading Mich\u00f4d\\'s script. \"Even in the way it looked on the page.  \"David\\'s got a very specific way of writing dialogue. It\\'s very functional, the writing\\'s very harsh, it\\'s savage, but it didn\\'t feel just stylised writing \u2013 it was emotional as well. It just seemed so natural compared to something like No Country for Old Men. I always felt that was more like film writing. And this didn\\'t really feel like a film script \u2013 it felt like a dream.\"  Pattinson has a very particular way of speaking: he will talk softly, intently about subjects you sense mean a great deal to him \u2013 Mich\u00f4d\\'s writing, for instance, or the craft of acting \u2013 only to then sweep it to one side with a flourishing \"It was crazy!\" or a burst of wheezy, slightly wild laughter. It gives the impression of someone who has not quite yet settled into his skin.  He had to audition for The Rover \u2013 a process he loathes. \"I\\'m quite good at doing meetings,\" he says. \"If I\\'m just meeting someone about a job I\\'m like a dog, especially if my agent\\'s said to me: \\'A lot of people want this job.\\' Then I\\'m like: \\'Oh yeah? Then I will do anything to get it!\\'\" What\\'s his technique? \"I don\\'t know, I just become a bullshit artist!\" he laughs. \"That\\'s when I start acting! I\\'m really much better at doing it when the cameras aren\\'t rolling ...\"  But auditions petrify him. He has spoken of the good 45 minutes of \"neuroses\" he has to suffer before any audition can ever really begin. \"I just can\\'t ... I literally can\\'t do it,\" he tries to explain. \"It\\'s just me looking uncomfortable, trying to put on an American accent ... or sitting in the corner, making myself throw up and punching myself in the face.\" What helps get him past the neuroses, what happens after those excruciating 45 minutes that helps him perform. \"Just that you think that someone actually believes you can do something,\" he says. \"That makes me sound like such an idiot. It\\'s crazy.\"  But the joys of acting still outweigh these moments.  \"For whatever reason, I think there\\'s something profoundly satisfying about being able to watch something you\\'ve done afterwards, or to just do a scene and feel like: \\'Oh, I just had an out-of-body experience for a second!\\'\"  He pauses. \"Just for one second,\" he says gently. \"And generally people don\\'t even notice. It feels literally like you\\'ve been asleep for a second.\" He recalls such a moment while shooting this film. \"It\\'s not the biggest scene, it\\'s not even in the movie, it was the rehearsal. And me and Guy had just been going so nuts \u2013 we\\'d been out in the desert and we\\'d become like crazy homeless people. And I turned around and looked at him and just realised actually, we\\'re not acting any more.\" He laughs. \"And why did that feel so good? It\\'s so weird.\"  It\\'s easy to assume that being tethered to the long-running Twilight Saga held him back from experiencing such moments, from growing as an actor, but he argues that the role required more resources than most. \"I think Twilight\\'s probably the hardest part I\\'ve done,\" he says, \"because to do it for five movies, it\\'s really hard to think of stuff that\\'s maybe not boring. Especially if you don\\'t die. Because what\\'s the drama? You\\'re not scared of anything! And that\\'s the whole essence of drama: life and death.\"  Pattinson was born and raised in London, but many of his film roles have required an US accent. In The Rover, Rey is from the American South, and like many has relocated to Australia in search of work in the mines. It was the voice, he says, that led him into the character.  He recalls \"losing my mind\" during his first day on set. \"It just didn\\'t feel right for ages,\" he says. \"And then there was this one little thing \u2013 I had this makeup on my teeth, and it kept rubbing off all the time. It was really putting me off \u2013 it meant I had to keep redoing scenes. So I started trying to do this thing where I covered my teeth with my lips. And it changes your voice a little bit, but I thought: \\'Oh, that\\'s really cool!\\' And after that I started speaking like that \\'ouhhggghhh ...\\'\" he replicates the style, and then laughs. \"It\\'s so silly, it\\'s so stupid! I was just kind of making the accent up, I don\\'t even know what state it is really.\"  But for Pattinson, having the opportunity to play a grubby-toothed mumbler from an unidentified corner of the American South proved liberating, as did the fact that his character plays second fiddle to that of Pearce. \"There\\'s something about Rey, and there\\'s something about not having to drive the story forward,\" he explains. \"You can just be the condiment. It\\'s really kind of freeing just being the sidekick weirdo.\"  He is full of praise for Pearce, for his physicality and his ability to transform himself for the role. He speaks of how, for much of their time on set, he thought Pearce to be physically bigger, and of his strange surprise when filming ended to find him not only clean-shaven but also somehow reduced in stature.  \"And I liked seeing that Guy, even after having done tons and tons of movies is still scared,\" he adds. \"I\\'ve worked with some actors who, having done so many movies, they just know what they\\'re gonna do. No matter what I would be doing in a scene they would have practised their part in a mirror already and that was it, whereas Guy is really trying to find it still. So that was why it was more fun \u2013 because neither of us really knew what the movie was about when we started. But he\\'s not afraid to let it happen. And there\\'s very few actors who\\'ve been doing it as long as he has that still approach it like that, that still have that element of danger.\"  How did they find out what the movie was about? \"I think it\\'s about the feel,\" Pattinson says. \"I think after I did Cosmopolis I realised that trying to psychoanalyse parts and trying to be all clever about it ... well, it only really started with actors in the 50s, and for thousands of years before that it was just about voice and using your body as a performance instrument ...\" he gives a faintly embarrassed laugh. \"So I generally think whatever feels nice, it\\'s probably right.\"  What felt nice in this role was the language, he says. \"It was all the little speech patterns. It was like a song - if you\\'re singing a song in a certain way you\\'re not trying to make it sound sad or something, it just is.\" He frowns. \"I keep trying to do that in movies, but it\\'s really difficult trying to find scripts that allow for it, that mean you don\\'t have to hit specific thematic beats.\"  Occasionally he tries to write something himself. \"I was trying to write a play the other day and I showed it to my assistant and didn\\'t quite realise how bad it was.\" He laughs and laughs. \"I was writing it totally by myself in the middle of the night thinking: \\'This is how you do it! You just stay up all night and keep writing!\\' She came in the next morning, and I\\'d been up all night writing. I said to her: \\'You have to read this! It\\'s amazing!\\'\" He could tell it was perhaps not, he says, from her facial expressions as she read. \"And then she said: \\'It\\'s not in English ... and half the time you haven\\'t even put the character names in so it\\'s just a stream of consciousness ...\\'\"  But he would like to be in a play, he says. \"Something in a really small theatre. I don\\'t think I could do something on Broadway ... But I\\'d quite like to do something kind of shocking.\"  He likes being shocking, he says, and his next role is satisfyingly so. Starring alongside Robert De Niro in Olivier Assayas\\'s Idol\\'s Eye, he will play a small-time criminal caught up with the Chicago mafia. \"My character is this slightly delusional lost child,\" he says. \"Everyone always glamorises criminals \u2013 it feels inevitable in movies \u2013 but in this it\\'s really not glamorised. It is quite dense. It\\'s really serious. Very political.\"  I think of something he told me earlier, about the ways in which he believes Twilight has influenced his career, and of how he wagers that most cinema audiences have judged him before he has uttered a single line on the screen. I pictured his frustration, the effort of forever trying to shake off that famous role, but on the contrary, he explained, he enjoys the possibilities that tension brings.  \"It\\'s kind of fun,\" he said. \"Because people have preconceived ideas about you, and sometimes it affords you the opportunity to shock people more.\" ',\n \"Here's How Caitlyn Jenner Celebrated Father's Day  Caitlyn Jenner took Father\u2019s Day to the extreme\u2014by going off-roading with members of her family.  \u201cGreat day yesterday for Father\u2019s Day,\u201d she tweeted, along with a photo. \u201cWe had so much fun off-roading.

TV heartthrob Milo Ventimiglia just signed on to Jennifer Lopez's upcoming romantic comedy, Second Act, and it sounds like we're going to see some sparks fly between them. Milo Ventimiglia will play J. Lo's boyfriend in the new movie, according to Variety, and the casting news has fans of the two stars shook.  Milo Ventimiglia will be playing the longtime boyfriend of Jennifer Lopez's character in Second Act, which is slated to come out next year. We don't know much about Ventimiglia's character yet, but the movie will be about Lopez's character reinventing her life, starting out as a Costco employee who uses her street smarts to make it big on Madison Avenue. Leah Remini will play the best friend of Lopez's character, and Vanessa Hudgens is also attached to play an executive at a consumer goods company. Other cast members include Freddie Stroma (UnREAL, Harry Potter), Dan Bucatinsky (Scandal), and Annaleigh Ashford (Masters of Sex).  This will be the first time Milo Ventimiglia and Jennifer Lopez have ever worked together on a project, which makes it all the more exciting for fans to see these super buzzy stars team up and play boyfriend and girlfriend on-screen. Just call them J-Milo. Or Mi-Lo. Maybe just Milo & J. Lo? I know there's a good couple name in there somewhere!  Although they've never worked together, Milo Ventimiglia and Jennifer Lopez actually have gotten to know one another better over the past year after both stars began helming their respective NBC series \u2014 Ventimiglia stars as the deceased father Jack Pearson on This Is Us and Lopez stars as police officer Harlee Santos on Shades of Blue. The two were photographed together at an NBC event back in March, and Lopez has even come out as a massive fan of Ventimiglia's show This Is Us. A couple months ago, she and her boyfriend Alex Rodriguez recreated a scene from the show in which Milo's character Jack did push-ups with his son Randall. Earlier this month, Milo's co-star Chrissy Metz said she was so surprised when she learned Jennifer Lopez was a major fan of the series.  It's safe to say J. Lo isn't the only massive Milo Ventimiglia fan out there. Twitter erupted in excitement after new of the casting broke on Wednesday afternoon. Check out some of the best responses below:  Although, I guess if you're a hardcore This Is Us fan, it may be hard to see Jack Pearson making out with J. Lo and not Rebecca (Mandy Moore). Second Act will be Milo Ventimiglia's first major motion picture in the romantic comedy genre since reemerging to TV fame in This Is Us. He first came to fame as another romantic lead: the small-town bad boy Jess Mariano in Gilmore Girls. His other major TV role between those two was as the paramedic-turned-superhero Peter Petrelli in the NBC drama Heroes.  Jennifer Lopez is best known for being the international pop star behind some of the biggest Top 40 songs of the 2000s, but she's also cultivated a respected career as an actress thanks to movies like Selena, Out Of Sight, and Maid in Manhattan. She currently stars in the crime drama Shades of Blue, and will star in NBC's next live musical: Bye Bye Birdie Live!  The news of Milo Ventimiglia and Jennifer Lopez playing boyfriend and girlfriend is exciting, but unfortunately fans are going to have to wait a while before they can see the on-screen couple together. Second Act is set to come out sometime in 2018, and since it sounds like they're just beginning the filming process now, it probably won't be until towards the end of the year. \",\n 'Drake Cancels Amsterdam Concert (Again) After Doors Had Opened  UPDATE: After this post was published,\\xa0TMZ\\xa0reported that the cancelation\\xa0was due to \"bad sushi.\"  Drake postponed his concert in Amsterdam Monday (March 27) night due to illness, disappointing fans who had already shown up to the Ziggo Dome.

',\n 'Kim Kardashian explains why she won\u2019t be voting for Trump after all  For a moment there, it seemed that Hillary Clinton had lost the Kim\\xa0Kardashian vote.  The reality TV\\xa0star backed Clinton as early as August 2015 and, in typical Kim\\xa0Kardashian fashion, had declared her allegiance via selfie.  But last week, reports emerged that Kardashian was thinking of voting for\\xa0Donald Trump\\xa0after\\xa0Caitlyn Jenner \u2014\\xa0a Republican who spoke during\\xa0the party\u2019s convention this summer \u2014 encouraged her to reconsider her vote.  It\\xa0all\\xa0stemmed from a Kardashian quote attributed\\xa0to an upcoming Wonderland magazine cover story. The quote does not appear in the online version of the magazine, but BuzzFeed reports\\xa0that it did appear in an advance version sent to certain outlets, including\\xa0to BuzzFeed UK.  The reported quote read: \u201cAt first I thought, \u2018Oh my god, I\u2019m so Hillary [Clinton],\u2019 but I had a long political call with Caitlyn [Jenner] last night about why she\u2019s voting Trump.

So she took to her website Saturday night and explained why she was \u201c\u2018on the fence\u2019 about my vote,\u201d she wrote.  [Master of horror fiction Stephen King says \u2018Trump presidency scares me to death\u2019]  \u201cThere was a point when I wasn\u2019t 100% sure I was even going to vote in this election; I didn\u2019t want to vote blindly,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I also thought about how not voting would mean that I wasn\u2019t making my voice heard, so I decided to talk to my closest friends and family who I love and trust, to have an open conversation about politics.\u201d  She\\xa0spoke with Jenner, who encouraged her\\xa0\u201cto do my research before making my decision and then vote for the candidate whose policies aligned with the things that matter most to me.\u201d For Kardashian, that included \u201cgun control and protecting women\u2019s rights to safe and legal abortion.\u201d  Kardashian continued: \u201cI found that without a doubt, I stand with Hillary.

This year, I\u2019m not just voting for myself, but also for my children, and I took that into careful consideration when I made my decision.\u201d  She also wrote that she believed both Clinton and Trump \u201chave the intention of making the country a safer and stronger place for every American.\u201d  Jenner, for her part, has made varying statements about Trump and Clinton. In a March episode of her show, \u201cI Am Cait,\u201d she said she was not a Trump fan because of \u201chis macho attitude\u201d but would \u201cnever ever ever vote for Hillary.

Naturally, the question comes from Kylie\\'s plastic surgeon, Dr. Simon Ourian. In an interview with Page Six \u2014 which, aside, has a terrible and patronizing headline \u2014 Dr. Ourian shared, \"I recommend that women stop getting lip fillers as soon as they learn they are pregnant. No one knows the implications of lip fillers on pregnant patients since dermal fillers haven\u2019t been tested on pregnant women.\"  He added, \"I would never knowingly administer lip injections to a pregnant patient.

And the filmmaker appeared unfazed as he spent some quality time with his 15-year-old in the English capital, enjoying a leisurely bike ride in the midst of the ongoing cross-Atlantic custody battle.  Guy and Rocco were clad in matching waterproof jackets and grey hoodies as they indulged in some gentle exercise following the stress of the court hearing earlier this week.  The Man From U.N.C.L.E director topped off his athletic look with a beanie hat, while Rocco sported a baseball cap.  The teen - who has been living with his father in London since fleeing his mother's Rebel Heart Tour in December - was busy checking his phone as he cycled along behind his dad.  Rocco is adamant he wants to continue living with his father in London, and it's claimed Madonna is close to agreeing to a deal.  The pair have been fighting for custody since December, culminating with Madonna's lawyers calling for Mr Ritchie to be arrested this week.  But sources say Madonna is close to agreeing a deal to let Rocco stay in the UK with his father, 47, so long as he returns to the US for regular holidays.  As news of the deal emerged, Madonna posted a bizarre video of herself online with the caption 'tears of a clown'.  The 10-second video shows the singer spinning and tap-dancing on a catwalk in a red polka-dot suit and mask.  The deal could finally be an end to the dispute which has been dragged through the courts since December, when the 15-year-old refused to go back to New York to see his mother.  A source close to the couple said: 'It's obvious they can't force Rocco to return and the judge was told he's too old to be forced,' reports The Sun.  'But Madonna wants to make sure she regularly sees him and they spend time together. They are just looking at the final details now like public holidays.'  Just yesterday, lawyers for Madonna demanded that the star's ex-husband Guy Ritchie be arrested for contempt of court for not abiding terms agreed in their divorce in 2008.  Her legal team made the dramatic demand during a bitter court hearing in New York which both she and Ritchie were listening to by phone.  Madonna's lawyer Eleanor Alter said that Ritchie should have brought Rocco to New York to resolve the dispute, because he was required to according to terms in the legally-binding divorce.  She said: 'He taught his son that obeying court orders was not important and I think that's one of the most serious things that's happened in this case that's detrimental to Rocco.'  Alter said that Ritchie's conduct was 'contempt' and the court went so far as to discuss the possibility that a warrant could be issued for Ritchie's arrest.  She added that the contempt should be enforced but New York Supreme Court Justice Deborah Kaplan refused to issue the warrant for Ritchie's arrest.  Ritchie's lawyer Peter Bronstein angrily rejected the demand from Madonna's team and said that his client had not even been held in contempt so an arrest was not being considered yet.  Justice Kaplan scolded both Ritchie and Madonna and said their son just wanted the case over.  She said: 'Frankly both parties have chosen to live their lives in a very public way and may welcome the publicity, but the child has not.  'He would like this matter resolved and the issues concerning him and his family in the most private way possible'.  Lawyers for both sides grew increasingly ill-tempered as the hearing went on.  See more of the latest Madonna updates as she fights for custody of her son Rocco  Alter, for Madonna, said that things she had been told by Mr Bronstein about English law had 'proved to be incorrect' and that some of the 'protections' she'd hoped for had not materialised.  She said that did not have an agreement on 'any part' of the case.  Mr Bronstein said that Ritchie and Madonna had been speaking directly to each other and by yesterday had drawn up an agreement which they had summarized into 24 points.  It broke down because of a number of issues including measures that allowed David Banda, the son Madonna adopted while married to Ritchie, to visit Rocco in London but make sure he returns to New York.  Mr Bronstein said there were still a 'number of differences which are extremely important to my client and, I understand, to the child'.  He went on to say that he had refrained from filing a number of papers which could be 'emotionally disturbing' to Rocco in the hope that an agreement could be reached.  He asked the court to lift Justice Kaplan's order from December requiring that Rocco return to New York but she rebuffed him.  Justice Kaplan told him that under the terms of Madonna and Ritchie's divorce, which was agreed in London in 2008, the Manhattan Supreme Court had ultimate authority over any custody matters, not the High Court in London.  Instead Ritchie has been going to the London court for hearings over the row, the court was told. Another one was due to take place in London on Thursday.  Justice Kaplan urged both sides not to take up what she called 'entrenched' positions and think about what was 'best for the child'.  She said that she thought that both parties were 'coming very very close to a global resolution that would take the child out of the unending spotlight'.  Alter seized on this and said that Ritchie's conduct amounted to contempt. She said: 'He thought it was better for Rocco to live with him.  'He may be right, I don't know. But the proper procedure was to come back to New York and ask for a change in circumstances. He used self-help.  'He taught his son that obeying court orders was not important and I think that's one of the most serious things that's happened in this case that's detrimental to Rocco.'  Mr Bronstein said that the mere suggestion Ritchie could be arrested cast a 'dark pall' over the hearing and said that the boy should be able to live in a 'normal household' with his father present.  Rocco's lawyer Ellen Sigal said that the teenager wanted his parents to 'put in place measures that will heal the rift that has arisen'.  She said that the case was proving to be a 'very difficult' time for him and that that she hoped he would not be exposed to any more 'distress and innuendo'.  She said that Rocco felt that the case was 'stressful and upsetting'. He is currently attending school in London and that she hoped Rocco's parents 'come to an agreement that will shield him from this matter'.  Madonna appeared by phone from New Zealand where she is due to play the next date in her Rebel Heart tour. Ritchie's location was not disclosed but is likely to have been London.  She spoke only at the start of hearing when asked: 'Is that Miss Ciccone?' and she replied: 'Yes, it's me.'  Ritchie only spoke to confirm he was on the phone too.  Earlier Justice Kaplan had agreed to let the press remain in the court because she did not believe that coverage of the case would cause a 'negative impact' to Rocco.  She said that the case had attracted 'extraordinary' media attention and that she had to balance the need for public access with the 'harmful effects' on Rocco.  The judge also allowed a single photographer in to take still photos of the hearing.  The case is to resume on 1 June.  The couple were married in Skibo Castle in Scotland in a high profile ceremony attended by Gwyneth Paltrow, Donatella Versace and Stella McCartney.  Madonna is also the mother to 19-year-old daughter Lourdes Leon, from her previous relationship to Carlos Leon, and adopted children David Banda, 10, and Mercy James, also 10 - David was adopted while she was still married to Guy.  Guy, meanwhile, has gone on to have three children with wife Jacqui Ainsley: sons Rafael, four, and Levi, one, and daughter Rivka, three.  Ritchie had been seen walking in London before the case was heard.  He and his superstar singer ex have been embroiled in a bitter legal battle over their teenager for the past few months.  Madonna has used social media to attempt to appeal to her son.  Two weeks ago she shared a nostalgic snapshot of herself with baby Rocco, reminiscing about happier times.  Along with the snap, she wrote, 'Tu me manque............(sic)', translated as 'I miss you'.  While some of her French fans were quick to point out that she had spelt 'manques' wrong, most of her followers chimed in with messages of love and support, reassuring the star that Rocco would no doubt change his mind.  'Be strong he will come back, he is just a teenager', one posted, while another enthused, 'He will always be your son and you always his mother'.  Rocco is said to have moved in which his father, 47, his model wife Jacqui Ainsley, 34, and their three children after becoming fed up with being on tour with his mother.  He was supposed to spend Christmas with her but did not return home to New York.  Madonna went to the Manhattan Supreme Court in December to try to force Rocco to come home.  But during the hearing Ritchie's lawyer Eric Buckley said that Rocco had 'expressed very clearly' that he did not want to be with her.  One possible source of Rocco's frustration is that Madonna posted numerous pictures and videos of him on Instagram that could have caused him embarrassment.  In May she posted one video of him doing a backflip wearing orange underwear with the caption 'Rocco's preferred profile #nosausage'.  In an interview in August Madonna said that Rocco did not want to perform on stage with her and would be working backstage on her tour as 'your mom is not cool' at his age.  The row has reopened old wounds from her and Guy's divorce after eight years together and put Madonna at the center of a painful and public battle.  Madonna reportedly thinks Guy's parenting is too lax and is said to have hired private detectives to spy on Rocco, who took pictures of him smoking underage. \",\n 'Now There\u2019s Video Proof That Michelle Obama and Beyonc\u00e9 Hang Out Together  Michelle Obama and Beyonc\u00e9 have never kept their mutual appreciation a secret.

The one\\xa0that made people furious, because it appropriated images from Black Lives Matter protests to sell soda?  Pepsi quickly pulled the ad after intense criticism \u2014 and in the six months since the controversy, Kendall hasn\u2019t publicly responded. That\u2019s because\\xa0she saved\\xa0it all\\xa0for the 14th season premiere of E!\u2019s \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians,\u201d which aired Sunday night.\\xa0The Kardashian family has said that Kendall was very upset over the backlash, and the premiere confirmed that, yes, the 21-year-old supermodel was\\xa0mortified.  Although the episode ended with\\xa0Kendall sobbing (\u201cObviously, if I knew that this was going to be the outcome, I would have never done something like this\u201d), it was a slow build to her breakdown. In fact, the word \u201cPepsi\u201d never came up during the entire hour. It all started as\\xa0Kendall called her sisters Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian.  \u201cAre you okay?\u201d Kourtney said when she answered the phone. \u201cYou sound so sad.\u201d  \u201cI talked to Simon today,\u201d Kourtney said, likely referring to Simon Huck, a public relations guru and Kim Kardashian West\u2019s close friend. \u201cHe was like, \u2018The news lasts 24 hours.\u2019 \u201d  Cut to an on-camera interview with Khloe, who explained to the audience: \u201cKendall did a commercial and basically caused a huge controversy. It sucks, because Kendall\u2019s been taking the blame for it all. Kendall tries really hard to be socially conscious and aware of the jobs that she takes and to really think about how things affect other people, so it weighs really heavy on her heart.\u201d  Producers showed some critical tweets about the commercial, such as, \u201cSo many adults had to f\u2011\u2011\u2011 up in so many unique and equally tone deaf ways to make this awful ad, it\u2019s honestly breathtaking.\u201d  Kourtney assured Kendall that she spoke to family friend Russell Simmons, who said that Kendall \u201ccan turn this into a positive.\u201d This is never further explained.\\xa0After they hung up,\\xa0Kourtney told Khloe that it sounded like Kendall was crying.  Later, Kendall explained why she filmed the commercial in the first place \u2014 when she got the offer, she was thrilled to join the list of celebrities who have done Pepsi ads, from Michael Jackson to Beyonc\u00e9 to Britney Spears.  \u201cI trusted everyone. I trusted the teams,\u201d she\\xa0told the camera. \u201cBut after I saw the reaction and I read what people had to say about it, I most definitely saw what went wrong. I was so stuck, and I really didn\u2019t know what to do, that I completely shut down.\u201d  The following scene showed Kendall sitting forlornly in her gigantic walk-in closet, talking to Kim on the phone. The new issue? Her father, Caitlyn Jenner, was going on a book tour.\\xa0Kendall was worried that Caitlyn might say something about the commercial that would make things worse.  \u201cShe just tends to, like, say a lot, and I just would rather everyone just not say anything,\u201d Kendall said.\\xa0\u201cI mean, God bless her for trying.\u201d  \u201cI know. But Caitlyn is known for saying all the wrong things,\u201d Kim said. She promised to call Caitlyn and let her know it was a very sensitive subject.  So Kim called Caitlyn and told her not to answer questions about the Pepsi ad \u2014 and if she felt compelled, just say something along the lines of, \u201cKendall had the best intentions with this being something, like, peaceful, and she totally gets everyone\u2019s point of view now. It was not appropriate, and she\u2019s so sorry.\u201d  Naturally, Caitlyn did not follow that advice, and instead\\xa0talked about the commercial in a radio interview and said Kendall knew all about the ad\u2019s script beforehand and thought it was fine.\\xa0The episode ended as Kendall went to talk to Kim, about three weeks after the commercial was pulled.\\xa0She was upset about Caitlyn, and even more about the whole situation.  \u201cI just feel really, really bad. Like, I feel really bad that anyone was ever offended. I feel really bad that this was taken such a wrong way,\u201d Kendall said. \u201cI genuinely feel like s\u2011\u2011\u2011, and I have no idea how I\u2019m going to bounce back from it.\u201d  \u201cThis is the first time you\u2019ve had a scandal,\u201d Kim gently reminded her. \u201cThis is your first real experience with something like this.\u201d  \u201cThe text messages I would get from people, they\u2019d be like, \u2018It\u2019s going to be fine, like, you know everything blows over in, like, a week\u2019s time\u2019 or whatever. And I\u2019m just like, \u2018Okay, but it\u2019s been, like, three weeks and it\u2019s not going anywhere,\u2019 \u201d Kendall said.  \u201cYeah, but it will,\u201d Kim assured her. \u201cThis is just going to be the biggest lesson learned for you.\u201d  \u201cI really don\u2019t even know what to do at this point. It\u2019s really depressing, and it bothers me every single day,\u201d Kendall said.  \u201cYou\u2019re the last person to want to hurt someone or be insensitive, but it\u2019s, like, it really sucks. I think the only thing you can really do is just be real and honest, because you can\u2019t ignore it. Like, you can\u2019t,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIt should affect you in a way where you grow from it, and you\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m a better person from it.\u2019 .\\u2009.\\u2009. I just wish that you could see that there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d  Despite Kim\u2019s words of wisdom, Kendall still broke down crying to the camera.  \u201cI would never purposely hurt someone, ever,\u201d Kendall said tearfully. \u201cYou don\u2019t know when you\u2019re in the moment, and, like, it was the most \u2014\u201d She grappled for the right words. \u201cI just felt so f\u2011\u2011\u2011ing stupid. The fact that I would offend other people or hurt other people was definitely not the intent. And that\u2019s what got me the most, is that I would have ever made anyone else upset.\u201d  After Pepsi pulled the ad, the company apologized\\xa0for putting Kendall Jenner in an awkward position. Last week, Pepsi chief executive Indra Nooyi\\xa0told Fortune\\xa0that\\xa0she didn\u2019t initially see the ad\u2019s final scene that caused so much \u201cconsternation,\u201d in which Jenner handed a cop a can of Pepsi.  \u201cThis has pained me a lot because this company is known for diversity, and the fact that everybody who produced the commercial and approved the commercial did not link it to Black Lives Matter made me scratch my head. I had not seen that scene,\u201d Nooyi said. \u201cAnd I take everything personally. The minute I saw people upset, I pulled it. And you know what, it\u2019s not worth it. There were people on both sides, but at the end of the day, our goal is not to offend anybody.\u201d  \u2018Clearly we missed the mark\u2019: Pepsi pulls Kendall Jenner ad and apologizes  The Kardashians aren\u2019t thrilled with Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s new book ',\n 'Who could succeed Anna Wintour at US Vogue?  As rumours that Sarah Jessica Parker will succeed Anna Wintour at US Vogue are shot down, we ask: Who could step into Wintour\\'s Manolo Blahniks when the time comes?  It\\'s possibly the most ludicrous fashion rumour we\\'ve ever heard but claims that Anna Wintour has been grooming Sarah Jessica Parker as her replacement at US Vogue got us thinking: who will replace her when she eventually leaves?  Wintour\\'s will be some metaphorically big shoes to fill, she is American Vogue. Here we place our bets...  Victoria Beckham: the chameleon    She\\'s come a long way since her days as a Zig-a-zig-ah-ing Spice Girl and now sits firmly at the top of the international fashion tree. Who\\'s to say she can\\'t morph into a magazine editor next?  Anna Dello Russo: the exchange programme    Can you imagine Vogue in the hands of the woman that brought us \\'Fashion Shower\\'. Wouldn\\'t it be amazing? A stalwart fashion editor, Dello Russo certainly has the vision, even if it is a bit, umm, outrageous.  Amy Astley: the safe choice    The editor-in-chief of Vogue\\'s little-sister publication Teen Vogue, Amy Astley has worked with Wintour before when she was a beauty editor at Vogue. Well respected in fashion circles, Astley would be a very safe pair of hands to leave big Vogue in.  Natalie Massenet: the business guru    The founder of Net-A-Porter, Natalie Massanet is an omnipotent presence in British fashion as the chair of the BFC. However, she\\'s US-born, used to be a fashion editor at Tatler and she\\'s got Wintour\\'s seal of approval. \"Natalie\\'s doing a very good job,\" said the editor-in-chief of Massenet\\'s impact on London Fashion Week. \"She\\'s a very organised person and she\\'s obviously having an impact on where the shows are located.\"  Eva Chen: the proteg\u00e9e    When Wintour became artistic director of Cond\u00e9 Nast she immediately bumped former beauty editor Eva Chen up to editor of Lucky, one of Conde Nast\\'s US titles. Chen is very well known, and liked, in the industry meaning the top title at Vogue may well be hers one day.  Marc Jacobs: the curveball    Think about it. \"He\\'s opinionated and has some spare time now [that he\\'s left Louis Vuitton],\" says Lisa Armstrong, \"also a brilliant stylist in addition to knowing what we all want to wear.\"  Tamara Mellon: the all-rounder    The Jimmy Choo co-founder has business savvy and a creative mind. Since setting up her eponymous label (in NYC, no less) she knows how to stand up to a boardroom of investors and get ideas off the ground. Plus she\\'s glamorous, supremely well-connected and used to work at British Vogue.  Tonne Goodman: the internal hire    Surrounded by British-born counterparts at US Vogue, Goodman, the magazine\\'s fashion director is like a fresh breath of Manhattan air. Styling tricky celebrities is her bread and butter, and no-one understands the demands of the high-earning American woman better than she.  Roger Federer: the sporty spice    OK, this suggestion is as likely as Andy Murray winning Wimbledon (oh... hang on) but the tennis supremo attends shows with Anna, while she cheers him on from the stands. He certainly knows how to wear a suit, and has probably learnt more than meets the eye from those fashion soirees the two love to hang out at.  John Galliano: the provocateur    A curveball perhaps but it\\'s well known that Anna is a huge supporter of Galliano\\'s. It was her that got him his first post-scandal job at Oscar de la Renta and what better way to bring him back to the top than to seat him in her big, shiny editor\\'s office?  Lena Dunham: the voice of a generation    Dunham is US Vogue\\'s current flavour of the month, quite literally, as she appears on the February cover - the result of months of wooing by Wintour, apparently. Often dubbed \\'the voice of her generation\\', she would certainly bring a new voice.  Lucy Yeomans: the Brit pick    Yeomans was appointed editor of Harper\\'s Bazaar in the UK when she was just 29 years of age. Now masterminding the launch of Net-A-Porter.com\\'s first print magazine, Porter, fashion journalism runs through her veins.  Meryl Streep: when life imitates art    As The Telegraph\\'s fashion editor Lisa Armstrong comments: \"If we\\'re choosing editors based on the fact they once played writers, what about someone who actually played an er, editor - Meryl Streep?\" A valid point we\\'re sure you\\'ll agree.  Stefano Tonchi: the editor\\'s choice    Italian-born Tonchi would be a publisher\\'s dream; he\\'s the current editor of style bible W (also owned by Conde Nast) and has previously worked at Esquire, L\\'Uomo Vogue and edited T: The New York Times Style Magazine. He moves in similar circles to Wintour and would be editorially-focused.

The Welsh beauty, 46, said: \"You\\'ve got to keep the home fires burning. It\\'s a long road and I think people today are so quick to throw in the towel.  \"You have to give it your best shot and not give up when the first problem arises.\"  Telling how they marked 15 years of marriage, she said: \"It was great. Just the two of us at one of our favourite restaurants, laughing that we haven\\'t killed each other yet \u2013 and that we\\'re still alive! Fifteen years is a long time.\"  The couple, who have son Dylan, 15 and daughter Carys, 12, reunited in 2014 after a brief separation, and also suffered the trauma of Michael\\'s cancer diagnosis in 2010.  On facing the illness together, she said: \"We tried to keep it as private as possible, but it\\'s very hard. I didn\\'t talk to other people about it enough. That\\'s one thing I\\'d do more of.  \"Our children asking, \\'Is Daddy going to die?\\' was really hard. It was an experience that I\\'m so happy is in our rear-view mirror.\"  Catherine, who plays journalist Rose Winters in the new Dad\\'s Army film, also denied she has ever been under the knife, though she did not rule it out for the future.  She told Good Housekeeping magazine: \"I\\'m not anti-plastic surgery. If I feel like it I\\'m going to go ahead and do it.\"  She credited exercise for her youthful looks, saying: \"I run on my treadmill or power walk outside, then do some bodywork and arm work and a bit of tap dancing. It\\'s healthy for a body to sweat every day.\" ',\n 'Taylor Swift\\'s \\'Reputation\\': All the gossip about Joe Alwyn, Kanye West and Tom Hiddleston  In the preface of her two Reputation-themed magazines, which feature photos, poetry and hand-written lyrics to celebrate the release of her sixth album, Swift lamented the inevitable news stories that guess at the targets of her lyrics.  \u201cWhen this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it\u2019s 2017 and if you didn\u2019t see a picture of it, it couldn\u2019t have happened right?\u201d  Yet, even with its controversy-winking title, Reputation is probably the least-gossipy release of Swift\u2019s career. Instead of an array of songs potentially referencing different ex-lovers, the majority of Reputation is dedicated to a single subject, whom Swift is still (as far as fans know) happily dating.  The allusions to Swift\u2019s past dramas are few and far between, and when they do show up on Reputation, they make for some of the album\u2019s very best songs. Swift steers clear of Katy Perry and squad drama and bashing her exes, keeping her apologies short, and list of enemies shorter.  More: Taylor Swift, pop princess, wins song of the year at the CMA Awards  Swift is a master at chronicling her soured relationships, with many of her finest songs memorializing (and sometimes flaming) her exes. So what happens when Swift writes an album about a person she\u2019s still into? That\u2019s the story of Reputation, and the British actor Joe Alwyn, whom Swift has been spotted with over the past year, is the man at its center.  \u201cOh, 25 years old / Oh, how were you to know,\u201d Swift sings on Dancing With Our Hands Tied, referencing Alwyn\u2019s age at the time she wrote the album (he\\'s 26 now). The \u201cocean blue eyes\u201d Swift sings about on Gorgeous almost certainly belong to Alwyn, a motif that repeats on Dancing With Our Hands Tied (\u201cDeep blue, but you painted me golden\u201d) and Delicate (\u201cOh damn, never seen that color blue\u201d). Swift also mentions his British roots in Gorgeous when she sings, \u201cYou should take it as a compliment that I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk,\u201d calling herself his \u201cAmerican queen\u201d on King Of My Heart and teasing, \u201cDo the girls back home touch you like I do?\u201d on Delicate.  And beyond songs like Gorgeous and Delicate that deliberately reference Alwyn, Swift spends the majority of Reputation lusting after, falling in love with and eventually pledging her loyalty to her new beau, the most time she\u2019s ever spent on a romantic upswing on one of her albums.  Taylor Swift and Kanye West (and her squad)  Swift came out of the gate swinging\\xa0on Reputation\\'s lead single Look What You Made Me Do, with lyrics like \"I don\u2019t like your little games / Don\u2019t like your tilted stage\" that seemed directed at West, the rapper who reignited their feud when he unceremoniously included Swift\\'s name in his Famous lyrics.  With an album\\xa0title like Reputation, fans speculated whether the entire album would be a vindictive screed aimed at Swift\\'s enemies. Turns out,\\xa0Look What You Made Me Do\\xa0was a red herring, and West barely makes an appearance in the album\\'s lyrics, save for one other song in which Swift laughing at the rapper as she dances on his grave.  The album\\'s third-to-last track,\\xa0This Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things, is a postmortem of Swift\\'s 1989 era, when she partied with her squad members on Instagram and was buddy-buddy with West, before 2016 arrived and Swift\\'s public persona took a hit.  \"It was so nice throwing big parties / Jump into the pool from the balcony,\" Swift begins, remembering \"feeling so Gatsby for that whole year\" before she gets to the chorus, singing with a smirk in her voice, \"This is why we can\u2019t have nice things, darling / Because you break them.\"  Then, it\\'s West\\'s turn. \"It was so nice being friends again / There I was giving you a second chance / But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand,\" she sings, referencing their fateful phone call about Famous that West\\'s camp recorded and later posted to smear her as duplicitous.  \"But I\u2019m not the only friend you\u2019ve lost lately / If only you weren\u2019t so shady,\" she continues, raising a toast to her real friends, her mother, and then eventually to West. \"And here\u2019s to you, \\'cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do,\" she says, before breaking down in giggles, saying, \"I can\u2019t even say it with a straight face!\"  This Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things\\xa0may be an enjoyable slice of pettiness, but the album\\'s crown jewel of gossip is Getaway Car, which sees Swift in full storyteller mode as she chronicles using one doomed relationship\\xa0to escape another.  With lyrics like\\xa0\u201cI wanted to leave him, I needed a reason\u201d and \"With three of us, honey, it\u2019s a sideshow,\" the song seems to reference the several months in 2016 when Swift parted ways with Calvin Harris and dated Tom Hiddleston immediately after, before eventually splitting with him too. To follow the song\\'s metaphor, Hiddleston is the getaway car driver who whisks Swift away from another man (\"Well he was running after us / I was screaming \u2018Go go go!\\'\").  In the end, she leaves him too, escaping with the fortune and singing, \"I put the money in a bag and stole the keys / That was the last time you ever saw me.\"  Swift may not want fans to linger on the gossip behind her songs, but when it\\'s as wonderfully told as\\xa0Getaway Car, honestly, who can blame them? ',\n \"Angelina Jolie Opens Up to PEOPLE About Her 'Difficult' Year: 'I Am a Little Bit Stronger'  Much has changed over the last year in Angelina Jolie\u2018s life, but one thing has remained constant \u2014 her dedication to her children.  After filing for divorce from Brad Pitt on September 19, 2016, Jolie retreated from the spotlight to focus on her family as they work to heal from the traumatic split.  \u201cI have had my ups and downs. I guess I am a little bit stronger,\u201d the actress, director and philanthropist tells PEOPLE exclusively in an interview for the magazine\u2019s new cover story. \u201cWe all have our difficult times, but as a mother you also have a responsibility first and foremost towards the kids. They are going through their formative years and everything else comes second to that.\u201d  With her children \u2014 Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, Vivienne and Knox, 9 \u2014 by her side, the superstar, 42, is back at work promoting\\xa0First They Killed My Father, a movie she directed for Netflix (debuting Sept. 15) based on her friend Loung Ung\u2019s memoir about surviving the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia.  For all the details on Jolie\u2019s new life, her emotional movie\\xa0First They Killed My Father and her hopes for her kids, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.  Jolie confirmed she plans on taking on more acting roles in the future, including Maleficent 2, but says her priority remains her children and their well-being.  \u201cEverything will be around the children,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t worked for over a year now because they needed me home. Everything was just stopped. I\u2019m really sitting and talking with them because everything affects them. Every location, every type of project, I\u2019m going to have to adjust it to however much they can handle.\u201d  In the interview, an emotional Jolie also talks about how she misses her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who died of cancer 10 years ago, more than ever \u2014and says her own health is good \u201cso far\u201d after her preventative surgeries to lessen the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.  She\u2019s very proud that Maddox and Pax got involved behind the scenes on First They Killed My Father. The movie grew from her longtime love for Cambodia, where she adopted Maddox in 2002 and where she has done humanitarian work for 14 years, establishing a foundation in Maddox\u2019s name that helps local communities with education, health and more. \u201cI wanted Maddox to see how extraordinary his country is,\u201d she says of the movie.  Though they are still healing from the last year, the star says her family is out of \u201clockdown\u201d and ready for new adventures.  \u201cI think they\u2019re itching to get out in the world again,\u201d says Jolie. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been a bit in lockdown and going through some things. I think it would be good to get out there and play together.\u201d \",\n \"Moving fashion forward: Brooding Tom Hiddleston has a new blonde in his life as he poses with dog for suave Gucci campaign after Taylor Swift split  He's one of Hollywood's most debonair stars.  So it's little wonder that Gucci have recruited Tom Hiddleston to be the face of their Cruise 2017 campaign, which sees the star decked out in an array of suave tailoring.  Moving forward from his sudden split with Taylor Swift, the 35-year-old actor shows of his leading man credentials as he takes centre-stage in the retro-styled campaign.  Flanked by a retinue of Afghan hounds, the High-Rise star seemingly replaced one blonde with three loyal ones.  Never failing to impress with his sartorial styling on the red carpet, the actor only seems a natural choice for the campaign.  Cutting a dashing yet suitably brooding figure, Alessandro Michele's vision for the Italian fashion house's resurgent menswear collection sees the actor captured in a series of homely tableau.  In one picture The Night Manager star is seen in a languid repose on a green sofa, staring off into the distance as if a he was a million miles.  Wearing a burgundy three-piece suit, slim-fitting and with razor-sharp lines, the actor certainly looks every inch the urbane gent.  In another shot, Tom is seen stood in the midst of three hounds decked out in a dark windowpane check two piece, ready for a day at the office - or indeed having just returned home from it.  The series of colourful yet muted portraits show the Thor and Avengers actor in his element, a subtle yet commanding presence - who looks even better thanks to the tailoring.  The campaign comes just weeks after the his relationship with popstrel imploded, with sources close to each of the stars claiming each of them ended it on their own terms.  However, last week Tom put paid to any rumours of hard-feelings or feuding between the two as he said they had remained on amicable terms.  When asked by People\\xa0at the Emmy Awards last week if him and Taylor had remained on friendly terms since the split he replied: 'Yes. Yes, we are,' with a smile. \",\n 'Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes Hit New York Fashion Week  Jamie Foxxand Katie Holmes have hit the Big Apple.   This unconfirmed pair has a knack for popping up in the same city around the same time and it happened again when the two actors were spotted separately throughout Manhattan this week as the bi-annual fashion week comes to another close.  While the Logan Lucky actress headed to fashion shows for Lanyu and Ralph Lauren earlier in the week, the musician attended other events around town, including the Sherri Hill fashion show, in which his daughter walked on Tuesday night, and the Hand in Hand celebrity benefit for hurricane relief.    While the Manhattan shutterflies haven\\'t caught the two together, it\\'s only been a week since a source confirmed the two stars spent Labor Day in Malibu together, \"holding hands\" along the sand.   \"They went in the water and were splashing around, flirting and getting close,\" the source added, describing the outing as a \"romantic date.\" TMZ also published photos of their holiday rendezvous. Meanwhile, the two have yet to confirm their longtime speculated romantic link. \"They are really happy,\" an insider previously told E! News. \"It\\'s easy and they are for sure very much in love.\"  Rochlin/Hand in Hand/Getty Images; Clint Spaulding/WWD/REX/Shutterstock Though we can only purely speculate that the two may have crossed paths while in New York, Foxx was focused on another special lady\u2014his daughter, Corinne Bishop. The actor was a proud dad Tuesday night as Bishop strutted the catwalk in elegant evening couture at Sherri Hill.    \"He\\'s like my number one fan,\" she told E!

The 37-year-old\\'s directorial debut All We Had follows the story of a single mother\\'s relationship with her teenage daughter, who tries to get her life back on track by moving to a small Midwestern town. Holmes, who directs and stars in the movie, said the storyline is one every mother can relate to, and was one of the reasons she was so excited to join the project. \"The mother-daughter theme (of) that unending love that you have for your mother and for your child is universal,\" she told Entertainment Tonight. And her 10-year-old daughter Suri, who she shares with ex-husband Tom Cruise, helped her to fully understand the mindset of Holmes\\' character Rita, which is why she gets a special thanks at the end of the film\\'s credits. \"She gets a special thanks for everything, (for) every job I do, because she makes every day great and awesome and better,\" Holmes shared. \"I know myself better because of her, so she\\'ll always get a special thanks.\" The actress, who shot to fame as Joey in Dawson\\'s Creek, revealed it took a long time for her to fulfill her dream of getting behind the camera. \"It\\'s taken a long time to take the risk,\" she said of her directorial debut. \"I feel fortunate because I have a wonderful support group around me.\" All We Had is set to be released in December. ',\n 'The new directions of One Direction: what do the solo projects tell us?  This morning, One Direction\u2019s Liam Payne dropped Stripped Down, his debut single, which can best be described as something that certainly exists.  That is, unfortunately, the nicest thing there is to say about the track \u2013 particularly when compared to the solo work of Payne\u2019s contemporaries Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson. Over the past year, the four seemed to have called dibs on certain sounds and musical influences, leaving Liam to try and marry the worlds of Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber, to no avail.  But we\u2019ll get to that in a second.  Here\u2019s who it seems the boys of 1D are modelling themselves after. Whether they\u2019re succeeding is another thing entirely.  Since he quit the band long before the boys called a hiatus, it\u2019s not surprising that the singer\u2019s debut (Mind of Mine, released in March 2016) seemed to dramatically strive to establish itself as the musical antithesis of One Direction. Between interviews that saw Zayn slagging off the band and his aesthetic rebrand that saw him secure a collaboration with Donatella Versace, Malik seemed keen to distance himself from the artist he used to be in the most dramatic sense.  Which explains why he took the Abel Tesfaye road of singing about sex, drugs, and a combination of the two. But where the Weeknd took years to earn mainstream recognition (and worked his way through the industry), Zayn\u2019s fanbase was already built in \u2013 which is why his rejection of One Direction seemed particularly harsh. So while Malik is a smart, talented, and multi-dimensional person, his debut lacked the authenticity that defines his fellow R&B artists. Not that he can\u2019t come back from that: having spent the past year opening up about his anxiety and keeping his head down, he could emerge for his sophomore effort as a grown-ass man, aware that the best artists are the sum of all parts \u2013 boy bands and all.  With Harry, it\u2019s a toss-up between Bowie and Jagger and even Robbie Williams \u2013 particularly when you consider the sweeping nature of Styles\u2019 first single, Sign of the Times. (Enter: Millennium.) But thanks to tracks including Carolina, Woman, and even Kiwi, the future Dunkirk star seems to have modelled his full-length debut after the expansive nature of Jagger and co \u2013 at least if you take into account how varied the Rolling Stones discography gets after leaping away from garage rock.  Which is something Styles seems to have emulated and recognized, from his stage presence (which he showed off on James Corden\u2019s Late Late Show all week) to his sense of fashion to the way his album reads like a generous tribute to British rock. No two songs are the same, nor are two tempos. Like Jagger, the singer sings primarily about women, his complicated relationship with them, and the experiences that come with being a young man. What will be interesting is whether he reinvents himself similarly as his career continues \u2013 dance moves and all.  Is this a stretch? Absolutely. But because Just Hold On saw Louis collaborate with Steve Aoki and do his own singing, it seemed the 1D alum was channeling 2017-era Harris (who\u2019s been singing his own songs) while simultaneously maintaining the DJ\u2019s long legacy of working with big names.  It\u2019s still a generous likening, especially since Louis has only delivered one track with no announcement of a forthcoming full-length. But that could also be a strategy: where his compadres are actively working the circuit, Tomlinson seems content to drop a banger every so often, leaving fans to thirst after him, instead of vice versa. His longevity, however, will depend on whether he gets behind the production board or begins working the DJ booth. Because as great as Calvin\u2019s Harris\u2019 vocals are, I don\u2019t think any of us need entire albums of them.  Here is a thing none of us were prepared for. Where Our Town seemed to solidify Horan as the next Shawn Mendes or Ed Sheeran, Slow Hands was on Bieber-circa-Girlfriend levels of catchy, thanks especially to a slowed-down, seductive beat.  Like Bieber via 2012\u2019s Believe, Slow Hands reintroduced Horan to his fans as an adult. But where Zayn used shock tactics to differentiate himself from his past, Niall borrowed from the pages of Bieber\u2019s book, and used his songwriting to prove he wasn\u2019t just some dude with an acoustic guitar. He could sing well, he could creatively adapt for a grown-up solo venture, and he still cherished his existing fan base and the legacy of his former self. Which Justin did, once upon a time, too: while Bieber leapt from child prodigy to rebel without a cause, his musical evolution never really faltered, and his career was kept afloat by the legacy he refused to condemn or distance himself from. So if Niall considers himself another Bieber, that would be brilliant: he would arguably be setting himself up for even bigger and better success, fortunately too old to relive Justin\u2019s 2013 ventures.  I ... don\u2019t know, you guys. I mean, you can see what Liam wanted to do: he wanted to grow up musically, borrowing from the gospel of Zayn by simultaneously throwing shade at One Direction while singing about sex and parties. The problem is, Strip That Down is even less believable \u2013 partially because Zayn has been candid about his partying and personal turbulence (where Liam is now a father) and because Zayn only ever dissed 1D in interviews, not in his actual music.  However, Strip That Down is largely a thirst trap, appealing to a tired brand of heteronormativity through Liam\u2019s references to \u201cgirl\u201d, whoever she may be. (Because my dudes, he\u2019s certainly not speaking to Cheryl that way.)  You can see the way he takes the Ed Sheeran approach to vocals, but loses the heart by bragging about how many women are hanging off him, and you can also hear the way he\u2019s using the Nick Jonas approach to post-band life by adopting slick beats while peacocking. The thing is, Sheeran and Jonas have both mastered their art by making songs seem sincere or as part of an in-joke with their audiences \u2013 they\u2019re not delivered on a platform built to broadcast their own greatness.  So here\u2019s hoping that Liam\u2019s next single features more of what he\u2019s actually good at: singing. Because while you know he\u2019s thinking of himself as a cross between Sheeran and Jonas, he\u2019s coming off as a salty brat who has no reason to complain about anything. ',\n \"Jennifer Aniston denies she had an affair with Matt LeBlanc  They had a steamy romance on screen.  But Jennifer Aniston has issued a denial, saying after the cameras stopped rolling, nothing ever happened between her and Friends co-star Matt LeBlanc.  Star\\xa0magazine has reported that the father of the 48-year-old actor, Paul, alleged his son did have a romance with Jennifer, 46, while they starred on the show.  And the 73-year-old went on to say it is supposed to have happened while she was married to her former husband Brad Pitt.  Speaking from his home in Clearwater, Florida, Paul claimed: 'He even had a relationship with one of of the girls...Jen.  'They would make out in the dressing rooms. He told me about it - it was when she was married to Brad Pitt.'  A rep for Jennifer has strenuously denied the story, saying:\\xa0I have commented in the National Enquirer and others. It's 100 percent false.  'Jennifer has never had a romantic or sexual relationship with Matt LeBlanc.'  The pair, who played Joey and Rachel on the global hit comedy, started a romance on screen at the end of season nine in May 2003 and the beginning of season 10.  Rachel starts to develop feelings for her friend who lives across the hall, and has dreams about him.  After Joey sees Charile (Aisha Wheeler) kiss Ross (David Schwimmer) he decides to go ahead with a relationship with Rachel, after she had confessed how she feels.  In season 10, which concluded in May 2004, the pair attempt to consummate their love, but fail and decide to remain friends.  Paul, who is estranged from his son, did not confirm at what point Matt and Jennifer are supposed to have got together in real life.  The Cake star was married to Brad, from 2000 to 2005.  Meanwhile Matt was with his ex wife Melissa McKnight - the pair tied the knot in 2003, after being together since 1997. They split in 2006.  Brad and Jen broke up after the 51-year-old actor made the movie Mr and Mrs Smith with his now wife Angelina Jolie.  The 40-year-old actress said in 2006 she met and fell in love with the Oceans Eleven star on the set of the movie, telling Vogue that they did not pursue anything romantically until he had announced his separation with Jennifer.  She said: 'It took until, really, the end of the shoot for us, I think, to realize that it might mean something more than we'd earlier allowed ourselves to believe.  'And both knowing that the reality of that was a big thing, something that was going to take a lot of serious consideration.'  The couple now have six children together, Maddox, 13, Pax, 11, Zahara, 10, Shiloh, nine, and twins Knox and Vivienne, who just turned seven.  Jennifer told the Hollywood Reporter\\xa0some years after the break-up:\\xa0'Nobody did anything wrong. 'You know what I mean?  'It was just like, sometimes things [happen]. If the world only could just stop with the stupid, soap-opera b******t. There's no story. I mean, at this point it's starting to become-please, give more credit to these human beings.' \",\n 'Jennifer Aniston Finally Pregnant At 48 Years Old? | Celeb Dirty Laundry  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have been married more than a year, so the inevitable pregnancy rumors will begin. According to the latest cover issue of Star Magazine, Jennifer Aniston is \\'finally\\' pregnant at 48 years old.  Now, we\\'ve heard in the past that Jennifer Aniston has struggled to get pregnant, even back when she was married to Brad Pitt. In fact, one of the most persistent rumors is that Brad Pitt dumped Jennifer Aniston because she couldn\\'t get pregnant, and he wanted children so badly. The fact that he went on to start a family with Angelina Jolie immediately after their divorce speaks to that rumor.  So poor single Jennifer struggled for a few years, until she met fellow famewhore-in-chief, Justin Theroux. The two stayed together, against all odds, and even decided to get married. And now, they are reportedly going to start having babies.  Sources tell Star, \"It\\'s taken Jen and Justin 16 months of IVF treatments, and they\\'ve been through so much heartache along the way, but now it seems their baby dreams have finally come true.\" The source also adds, \"I\\'m sure they\\'ve already planned to throw two baby showers in L.A., one for Jen and one for Justin, since this is his first time being a dad.\"  Well, first \u2013 Jennifer Aniston pregnancy rumors are nothing new. We\\'ve heard this time and time again, and this is probably the 400th time that tabloids have come out with a Jennifer Aniston Is Pregnant! Cover. However, we have to question \u2013 could this time actually be true? You can only throw darts at the board for so long before they start sticking to the board, and this might be an instance where the tabloids have guessed about it or so long that it\\'s now coming true.  However \u2013 even if Jennifer Aniston is pregnant (and that\\'s a big if) \u2013 it is extremely unlikely that they\\'re planning on throwing two baby showers; that seems excessive, even for them. While a pregnancy would undoubtedly be good news for the couple, they would probably want to keep it undercover \u2013 at least for a little while \u2013 and throwing two big baby showers isn\\'t going to help them keep the news discreet.  Or heck, maybe they want the attention \u2013 they\\'ll be able to use the pregnancy to sell their movies, TV shows, etc. Come back to CDL for all your Jennifer Aniston news and updates.

They then brought up a headline about Kendall Jenner and Scott Disick that read: \"Kendall: How Scott Seduced Me!\" It referenced the ongoing rumor that Kendall and her older sister Kourtney \\'s former partner (and the father of her three children) were in a relationship. Kendall responded: \"I didn\\'t even know that existed. I was 19. That was two years ago.

The 'Story Of My Life' singer was pictured alongside Keeping Up With The Kardashians star Kendall late last week (2nd January) on a winter sports holiday out in Mammoth, California.  Harry opted to dress all in black for his day out alongside Kendall and friends, carrying his skis and poles alongside a pair of mirrored goggles.

In a searingly honest interview with GQ the 53-year-old Hollywood star described the battle for custody of their six children, and how he had given up drinking last year in favour of cranberry juice.

The trainer said they did back-to-back weight exercises rather than cardio to get Jackson\\'s heart rate up and to help her burn fat. \"What that does -- you would look at her and think she\\'d done like an hour of cardio with me -- but when you\\'re working with weights and you\\'re working the muscle that way, it elevates the heart rate, but also it\\'s creating that fat-burning effect, both during the session and also when she left me, and that was key,\" Sybliss said.

You won\\'t get fat overnight.\" ',\n 'Angelina Jolie on Cambodia \\'awakening\\'  Angelina Jolie has spoken about how Cambodia was her \"awakening\", as she premiered her new film in the country.  The actress was speaking exclusively to the BBC before the screening of First They Killed My Father, a true-life account of the Khmer Rouge genocide through the eyes of a child.  She said she hoped the film, which she directed, would help Cambodians to speak more openly about the trauma of the period.  Jolie, now a UN refugee agency special envoy, first visited Cambodia for the filming of 2001 hit Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.  She later adopted Maddox, her oldest son, from Cambodia.  \"I came to this country and I fell in love with its people and learned its history, and in doing so learned, how little I actually knew about the world,\" she told the BBC\\'s Yalda Hakim.  \"This country, for me was my awakening.  \"I\\'ll always be very grateful to this country. I don\\'t think I ever could give back as much as this country has given me.\"  First They Killed My Father is based on a book of the same name by Loung Ung.  Ms Ung was five when she and her family were forced to leave their home in the capital, Phnom Penh, by the Khmer Rouge, the regime which ran the country between 1975 and 1979, under Pol Pot.  It is estimated that about two million people, around a quarter of the population, were either murdered by the regime or died from starvation and overwork.  \"I thought that this war that happened 40 years ago, and what happened to these people, was not properly understood,\" said Jolie.  The film is predominantly in the local Khmer language, and Jolie said that while she wanted the wider world to better understand events in Cambodia she hoped it would have an impact domestically too.  \"I hope it helps the country speak more,\" she said, as many survivors \"haven\\'t told their children their story\".  The film, made by Netflix, was given its world premiere on Saturday inside the Angkor temple complex in Siem Reap, where Tomb Raider was partly filmed.  Among those present alongside Jolie and her six children was Cambodia\\'s King Norodom Sihamoni, who in 2005 granted the actress Cambodian citizenship for the work done by an environmental foundation she established in the country.  The premiere was the first major public appearance for Jolie since she filed for divorce from Brad Pitt in September last year, citing irreconcilable differences.  The couple had been together since 2004 but only married in August 2014.  \"It was very difficult,\" Jolie said. \"Many people find themselves in this situation. My whole family have all been through a difficult time. My focus is my children, our children.  \"We are and forever will be a family and so that is how I am coping. I am coping with finding a way through to make sure that this somehow makes us stronger and closer.\"  Oscars 2017: what\\'s up for best foreign language film?

To mark the occasion, the living legend sat down with Yahoo\u2019s Katie Couric to share some of her secrets to living a long and fruitful\\xa0life. \u201cI am\\xa0the luckiest old broad on two feet,\u201d she acknowledged.  See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour \u00bb  As a birthday gift, Couric brought White a stuffed sloth, which led to the revelation that the birthday girl has an entire room in her home dedicated to stuffed animals.  \u201cI\u2019m a little strange for stuffed animals,\u201d said White. \u201cI\u2019m a little strange for\\xa0any\\xa0kind of animals.\u201d  When asked about a typical day in her life, White said she always gets up early, though in her case, she has a little help via a quick puppy kiss.  \u201c[My dog] comes over and he lets me know when it\u2019s 6:30,\u201d said White.

Well, you\\'re in luck. At least if you\\'ve got some money on hand and are feeling generous.  Twenty years after their tragic onscreen love story ended, the Titanic costars are reuniting for a good cause: At this year\\'s Auction Gala, hosted by the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, one lucky bidder will have the chance to have a private dinner with Jack and Rose\u2014erm, Leo and Kate\u2014at the NYC restaurant of their choosing sometime in October or November, People reports .  The star-studded event is set to take place in St. Tropez on July 26, and proceeds from the dinner and auction will go to support environmental causes via the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. According to People , last year\\'s gala raised $45 million, and the Foundation has reportedly donated over $80 million in environmental grants since its conception in 2008. Proceeds from the dinner with DiCaprio and Winslet, specifically, will also be put toward the Golden Hat Foundation, which benefits children with autism and their families, and a GoFundMe campaign that Winslet is involved with that\\'s attempting to raise money to help a young mother in the U.K. afford cancer treatment.  In addition to getting the chance to bid on dinner with the greatest doomed onscreen couple of our time, gala guests will be treated to a special performance by Lenny Kravitz. According to a statement from the Gala, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo will also be in attendance to receive the \"New World Leadership Award\" in honor of her \u201cinnovative approach to making Paris a model for sustainable urban living and design,\u201d People adds.  If last year\\'s guest roster was any indication, the invite list rivals the likes of the Met Gala and the Academy Awards. Past attendees have included Bono, Chris Rock, Mariah Carey, Tobey Maguire, Jonah Hill, Naomi Campbell, Bradley Cooper, and Edward Norton. And according to E!, this year\\'s list of chairpeople for the event includes Madonna, Cate Blanchett, Emma Stone, Marion Cotillard, Tom Hanks, Jared Leto, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, and Kate Hudson, among others.  For anyone who didn\\'t make the invite list (or doesn\\'t have hundreds of thousands of dollars to shell out on a single dinner) but still wants the chance to sit next to DiCaprio, try your luck at flights from Los Angeles to St. Tropez: Word on the street is that he\\'s flying commercial to the event.

She used a damp wedge sponge to perfect our cover model\\'s skin with just a touch of CoverGirl Simply Ageless Concealer and Corrector. \"Ellen\\'s skin has a natural glow already, so she doesn\\'t need much makeup,\" says Pati. Not all of us are blessed with such youthful skin, but you can get an amazing complexion like Ellen\\'s with these anti-aging tips from the makeup pro:    You are what you eat  Ellen sticks to vegan fare and practices yoga, and it\\'s written all over her face. Boosting your intake of antioxidant-rich fruits and veggies and cutting out processed foods helps give you that luminous look.    Cleanse carefully  Face washes that lather up contain sulfates, which can dry your skin and make fine lines and wrinkles look worse. Instead, go for a cleansing cream that doesn\\'t suds; it will leave skin soft and get rid of makeup and grime.    Quench thirsty skin  If you\\'re super dry, consider using a face oil at bedtime. These hydrating serums give your skin an extra plumpness and dewiness. Smooth on after cleansing and top with your night cream.    Give powder makeup the brush off  Powders can sink into lines, so switch to cream-based blushes, shadows, concealers and foundations. As you age, your skin loses radiance, so give it a boost with sheer, hydrating formulas that contain light reflecting particles.    Go easy on the eyes  Lots of eye makeup can attract attention to crows feet. Use neutral shadows and a dab of smudgey liner instead of attempting a come-hither smoky eye or garish colors.    Choose the right lip look  Tons of super shiny lip gloss can make you look like a teenager, while dark matte lipsticks can make lip lines look more prominent. Go for something in between; I recommend a hydrating sheer lipstick one shade darker than your lip tone. ',\n 'Prince died of accidental overdose of opioid fentanyl, medical examiner says  Ramsey, Minnesota (CNN) Toxicology tests for Prince concluded that the entertainer died from an accidental overdose of the opioid fentanyl, according to a report on his death by the Midwest Medical Examiner\\'s Office.  Prince, whose full name was Prince Rogers Nelson, died April 21 at age 57, after being found unresponsive in an elevator at Paisley Park, his home and recording studio in Chanhassen, Minnesota.  The report from the medical examiner\\'s office, which was released on Twitter, didn\\'t provide many details. \"How injury occurred: The decedent self-administered fentanyl,\" the report said. For manner of death, a box was marked for \"accident.\"  The report didn\\'t specify how the drug was taken and if the fentanyl was prescribed or illegally made.  The music superstar weighed 112 pounds and was 63 inches tall when he died, the report said. He was wearing a black cap, shirt, pants, boxer briefs and socks and a gray undershirt, the report said. His occupation was listed as \"artist\" and his business as \"music.\"  The full autopsy and toxicology reports will not be released, the office told CNN.  Since his death, information has emerged about the entertainer\\'s alleged abuse of prescription drugs.  A law enforcement source told CNN\\'s Evan Perez in April that the entertainer was found with opioid medication at the time of his death. Investigators so far haven\\'t found any indication that Prince had a valid prescription for the recovered opioid medications  An attorney for Prince\\'s half-siblings said they revealed the singer had an addiction to Percocet decades before he died. One half-sibling said Prince started using the drug to help him deal with the rigors of performing, not for recreational use.  On April 15, on his way home after performing in Atlanta, Prince\\'s plane made an emergency landing in Moline, Illinois. Prince was unresponsive and taken to a hospital. A law enforcement official told CNN he was treated for a potential overdose of pain medication.  The day before Prince died, his team called an eminent opioid addiction specialist in California seeking urgent help for the singer, an attorney working for the specialist and his son said.  The specialist, Dr. Howard Kornfeld, couldn\\'t get there immediately so he sent his son, Andrew Kornfeld, on an overnight flight to Minnesota. The goal was for the younger Kornfeld to help evaluate Prince\\'s health and encourage him to enter treatment for pain management and potential addiction issues, attorney William Mauzy told reporters.  But by the time Andrew Kornfeld arrived at the singer\\'s Paisley Park complex on the morning of April 21, it was too late. He and two Prince representatives found the 57-year-old entertainer unresponsive in an elevator. Andrew Kornfeld was the person who called 911, Mauzy said.  Authorities have also said the investigation into Prince\\'s death is a criminal investigation. It was not immediately clear if Kornfeld is the subject of a separate investigation.  Federal prosecutors and the Drug Enforcement Administration are investigating how Prince obtained prescription medications and from whom, the agencies said.

The country starlet turned pop phenom - who won four Moonmen at last year\\'s ceremony, including Video of the Year for her celeb-packed \"Bad Blood\" visual - was not nominated for any Moonmen this year, though her clips for \"Wildest Dreams\" and \"Out of the Woods\" (off her blockbuster 1989 album) were both eligible.    While neither video is up for an award, the award show is still technically honoring Swift, 26, if you consider her contributions to ex-beau Calvin Harris\\' Rihanna-assisted hit \"This Is What You Came For,\" which is nominated for Best Collaboration. The \"Shake It Off\" hitmaker secretly sang on the track and wrote it under the pseudonym Nils Sjoberg.    Despite her lack of nominations, the Grammy winner never planned on attending this year\\'s show. Though fans will undoubtedly miss Swift\\'s presence on Sunday night, the highly anticipated event is shaping up to be one of MTV\\'s most epic yet.

He found his biological mother and for a time his search for his biological father pointed to no less than John Frankenheimer, the auteur director of \"The Manchurian Candidate\" and other Hollywood classics.  Gene tests later proved Bay was not Frankenheimer\\'s son, and the trail went cold. But in his career, Bay has two \"dads\" who share his creative DNA: Jerry Bruckheimer and Steven Spielberg.  Having such hitmakers as his guides has served Bay well, and he\\'s repaid their support handsomely. Bruckheimer served as a producer on Bay\\'s first five films, including such hits as \"Bad Boys,\" \"The Rock\" and \"Armageddon,\" and Spielberg produced his last three, the \"Transformers\" pics. The franchise has already grossed more than $1.5 billion worldwide between the first two films, with the latest sequel expected to break box office records this weekend.  His one feature that had neither as producer, \"The Island,\" is Bay\\'s lowest-grossing picture. (Though since DreamWorks released the film, Spielberg was involved in some capacity.)  Bruckheimer shepherded Bay into feature films in the mid \\'90s, but their relationship goes back more than 20 years. \"I saw Michael\\'s commercial reel and thought that he had a combination of an amazing sense of humor and a great sense of visual style,\" Bruckheimer says. \"Michael did a very good video for us on \\'Days of Thunder.\\' Even though he had only done a couple of videos at that point, it was easy to see how talented he was.\"  Bruckheimer expected Bay to become a big event filmmaker, he says, \"because Michael had such strong vision and the will to get it on camera.\"  Bruckheimer describes Bay as \"a born filmmaker,\" though the producer did work with the director to develop his \"clarity of storytelling and depth of the films\\' characters.\"  Spielberg fills a different role than Bruckheimer in guiding Bay, since he\\'s a director himself. Spielberg emerged from TV and the twilight of the studio system to direct blockbusters before tackling more serious pics. There are hints he sees some of himself in Bay.  He says since he started working with Bay on the \"Transformers\" pics, \"I think our relationship has gotten looser over time, in the sense that we laugh a lot more about how hard movies like \\'Transformers\\' are to mount and make. I really believe that once the \\'Transformers\\' franchise is out of his system, Michael will take his visual gifts and begin to apply them to many different kinds of stories, even quiet ones.\"  Spielberg notes that while Bay is \"a powerful and provocative image maker,\" on this latest \"Transformers\" pic, \"Michael was very focused on telling a story more character-dependent than \\'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.\\' \"  Bruckheimer offers this summary of why Bay\\'s blockbusters consistently shine at the box office.  \"Michael likes taking huge audiences, packing them into a Howitzer of his own design, and firing them into the experience,\" Spielberg says. \"There are millions of people who love the thrill rides that Michael designs for them.\" ',\n \" Angelina Jolie Embraces Her Inner-Witch, and Inner-Mom  The news that Angelina Jolie's daughter, 4-year-old Vivienne, will appear with her mother in the live-action movie Maleficent, in which Jolie plays the titular sorceress, has already sparked a predictable array of nepotism jokes. And while I'm sure Vivienne got a massive leg-up because of who her parents are, there's also something awfully fun about seeing Jolie play both with her public image as a practitioner of the dark arts, and her private life as a mom.    For more than a decade, Jolie has been saddled with a witchy reputation, one that wasn't based in Hollywood diva behavior but in small acts that assumed great proportions in the public mind. When she married co-star Jonny Lee Miller, Jolie took her vows in a T-shirt emblazoned with his name written in her own blood. And after she and actor Billy Bob Thornton wed, they famously wore matching necklaces with vials of each other's blood. Gossips tutted about a smooch Jolie laid on her brother at the Academy Awards, and the actress ran through the list of tabloid-sating provocations, dating actress Jenny Shimizu, discussing her history of self-mutilation comfortably in public, and talking about BDSM with a fluency that would set E.L. James a-scribbling.    Taken together, all of the above combined to paint a portrait of a powerfully alluring woman with deep uncertainties about herself and her choices. When Brad Pitt divorced Jennifer Anniston to be with Jolie, now his fiancee after seven years and five children together, the romance provided a narrative that seemed to solidify Jolie's public image. In the pages of gossip rags she was an enchantress, a creature of blood and sex, qualities never entirely erased by her eventual transformation into mother of three children by Pitt and three others by adoption.  Which is why it's so awesome that Jolie is starring in a children's movies as a witch, rather than as a princess or a warrior. Witches may bear the weight of public disapproval, but the hero often needs them at the beginning of the journey, and the adventure often involves the hero learning to see the world with some of the wisdom and disappointment that inform the witch's perspective. But even in movies with bad-ass princesses like Brave's Merida, the witch who gets consulted halfway through the story is a wizened old crone with a fondness for whittling. Outside the sympathetic librettos of Stephen Sondheim, witches don't really even get much of a chance to compete for the title of hero.  So I've loved seeing Jolie don horns and fly around in harnesses in set photos from Maleficent. And I'm even more excited that she'll be bringing her daughter to work with her. The movie's a reminder that we should consider sympathizing with the witches a little bit more frequently. And Vivienne's appearance is a joke on all the people\u2014including Jolie's father, Jon Voight\u2014 who suggested Jolie was an unfit mother. Witches don't just lock adorable blonde princesses in towers. Sometimes, they give birth to them.   \",\n \"Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn Spend Time with Her Family: 'She Seems Relaxed and Very Happy,' Says Source  Over the weekend, Taylor Swift, 27, and Joe Alwyn, 26, jetted to the States from the U.K. and spent some quality time with her parents, a source tells PEOPLE exclusively.  \u201cThey arrived in Nashville on Friday and spent the weekend there together,\u201d says the source. \u201cJoe hasn\u2019t spent very much time with her family before, so it does seem they are getting more serious.\u201d  For more on Taylor Swift\u2019s new romance with Joe Alwyn, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.

With the Duke and Duchess planning to take on more royal engagements and Prince George, 3, due to start school at Thomas\u2019s London Day School in Battersea from September, a move for the family of four made sense.  Announcing the news, they released an official statement: \u2018Their Royal Highnesses love their time in Norfolk and it will continue to be their home. From this autumn, however, the Duke and Duchess will increasingly base their family at Kensington Palace. As they have in recent years, their royal Highnesses are keen to continue to increase their official work on behalf of the Queen and for the charities and causes they support, which will require greater time spent in London.\u2019  With the move scheduled to take place in the coming months, it comes as no surprise that the Duke and Duchess are already starting to make Kensington Palace ready for the family or four (plus Lupo the cocker spaniel).  Having renovated the palace a few years back in a \u00a31 million revamp, Kate Middleton is said to be enlisting the help of interior designer to the stars, Ben Pentreath, to help give the palace a more homely vibe.  The designer, who helped decorate her Norfolk home, Amner Hall, and who boasts a star-studded client list from Liv Tyler to Sarah Jessica Parker, is said to be helping Kate to decorate and furnish apartment 1A of Kensington Palace, giving it a traditional and luxurious feel.  According to Hello! magazine, the Duchess has gone for a neutral colour palette, decorating her drawing room with traditional furnishings from long floor-length curtains, plants and tapestry rugs, to cream lamps and gold framed artwork. There\u2019s also said to be a few modern additions, including an octagonal coffee table and some fluffy cushions.  We\u2019re getting some serious interiors envy already \u2013 If you\u2019ll excuse us we\u2019re off to buy some cream lamps and fluffy cushions. ',\n \" Does Drake's New Single Mean He's Already Done With His Most Recent Album?  Just over one week ago, Drake surprised the world by announcing a new single was on its way, and then by dropping said track just a few days later in the middle of a Louis Vuitton runway show in Paris. For those who didn\u2019t get an invite to the exclusive event, \u201cSigns\u201d was uploaded to Spotify shortly thereafter, and since then it's been streamed millions of times and discussed at length across social channels.  The new Drake track sounds like it could be the next big hit for the hip-hop superstar, who obviously wants to own the summer in the same way he did last year with his first No. 1 hit as a lead artist, \u201cOne Dance.\u201d \u201cSigns\u201d has yet to hit the Hot 100, but it will in a short time, and it could grant the rapper another serious smash.  Many people have started wondering what the release of this new poppy offering means for Drake, who is only a few months removed from his last chart-topping effort on the Billboard 200. As always, he has been mum on the subject, but there is plenty of precedent in his past to suggest that a new collection could already be in the works from the biggest name in music.  Over the past few years, Drake has sped up his release schedule, and he never allows much time to pass in between one album and the next (or whatever he\u2019s calling them these days). He dropped two mixtapes in 2015, an album in 2016 and less than a year later in March 2017, his playlist project More Life topped the albums tally with ease. All of those items were massive moments in music and successful in terms of sales and especially streams, and while he could have kept them alive and promoted them more intensely, Drake doesn\u2019t seem concerned with the shelf life of his music, instead focusing his energy on creating more and more content.  It might only be a few months old, but the superstar Grammy winner seems to have already moved on from More Life, even though it remains inside the top 10 on the Billboard week after week. He hasn\u2019t gone out of his way to do much in the way of promotion, and while every track featured on the collection initially charted on the Hot 100, only two have managed to hold on, and neither is currently residing inside the top 40 any longer.  Drake also has a habit of mixing timelines and pushing more than one project simultaneously, which would likely be disastrous for any other artist. Back in July 2015, he unleashed \u201cHotline Bling,\u201d which would quickly go on to become one of his highest-charting efforts and something of a signature song. Just a\\xa0few months later, he and Future dropped their collaborative mixtape What A Time To Be Alive, which confusingly didn\u2019t feature \u201cBling.\u201d That song wouldn\u2019t end up on a collection until nine months later, when Views finally conquered the world. The name Drake turned out to be powerful enough to keep both the song going and to send\\xa0What A Time To Be Alive to the top of the Billboard 200 without issue, so now he knows he can balance two different projects at once.  At the moment, \u201cSigns\u201d is currently being pushed as a standalone single, but in Drake\u2019s world, that could change in a moment. Depending on how well it performs on the charts and how long it is able to last, it could wind up serving as the lead cut from an upcoming album, or mixtape, or playlist project or anything really. Drake has established himself as not only one of the most successful artists of all time, but also one of the most unpredictable, which is what is required by today\u2019s fast-paced music industry. \",\n 'Miranda Lambert Writes Loving Post for 2-Year Anniversary with Boyfriend Anderson East  Miranda Lambert\\xa0marked her second anniversary\\xa0with\\xa0Anderson East\\xa0Tuesday by sharing a sweet snap on Instagram of herself and her musical beau sharing a kiss.  \u201c\u2018Oh how I remember well, sunset on September 12th\u2026\u2019\\xa0#PushingTime\ud83c\udfb6\\xa0#2yearstoday\u2764\ufe0f#bamaboy\\xa0@andersoneast\\xa0\ud83d\udcf7@bfluke,\u201d she wrote in the caption.

A source told the publication that their relationship is \"very fresh,\" adding, \"They hook up, but are still hooking up with other people.\"  Don\\'t expect Iggy and Odell to go Instagram official any time soon, though; on Friday, Iggy took to Instagram to tell her side of the story, explaining that she and Odell aren\\'t dating and have never dated.  \"Stop trying to make me and Odell a thing,\" she wrote. \"We weren\\'t dating back in May and we\\'re not dating now!\"  \"I try my best to stay quiet and not let the things I see written throw me off; but today this sh*t is taking a toll on my REAL, PRIVATE, LIFE and the people in it I care about in a way that\\'s got me losing sleep,\" she continued. \"I can\\'t sit back and let you all drag my name in the mud talking about how I\\'m someone\\'s f*ck friend, when Ive [nothing[ but mind my business.\"  \"Keep my name out of your fanfiction, Soap opera, bored housewives b*llshit - Please!\" she finished. \"That sh*t you say for fun & games really effects peoples real relationships.\" ',\n 'Caitlyn Jenner: Robert Kardashian Believed O.J. Simpson Guilty of Murder  Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s forthcoming memoir, The Secrets of My Life, is billed as a book in which she \"reflects on her past as she looks to her future.\" While she touches on a number of topics, such as her Olympic triumph and three failed marriages, the revelation that Robert Kardashian allegedly told her that he believed O.J. Simpson was guilty of killing Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman is making waves.  According to Radar Online, which obtained an exclusive copy of the book, Jenner talks about a car ride she took with Kardashian in the 1990s following Simpson\\'s civil trial and claims he said, \"I would\\'ve been okay with it if they had gotten him in the first trial.\" The implication, as Jenner goes on to explain, \"was obvious that he believed O.J. was guilty.\"  Even so, as one of the three members of Simpson\\'s defense team, and a good friend of the Hall of Fame football and movie star, Jenner asks herself if Robert Kardashian\\'s decision to continue defending Simpson was his way of getting revenge against his ex-wife Kris Jenner because he knew it would upset her. Kris married Caitlyn (then Bruce) Jenner in 1991 months after her divorce from Robert Kardashian. Kris Jenner also considered Nicole Brown Simpson one of her best friends.  \"I wonder if it was his way of saying to [Kris] what I think she was saying to him when she married me: a big fuck you,\" Jenner reportedly writes.  Jenner reportedly goes on to call Simpson \"the most narcissistic, egocentric, neediest asshole in the world of sports I had ever seen\" and say he got away with \"two savage murders.\" According to Radar Online, Jenner also forbade her stepdaughters from saying Simpson\\'s name in the house after Kourtney Kardashian said \"I told you he didn\\'t do it!\" when he was found not guilty by the jury in 1995.

Charlize Theron and Sean Penn share a tender moment as they arrive in NYC with her son Jackson  It was recently claimed that Sean Penn he is selling his Malibu home in order to begin again with his longtime love and rumoured fiance, Charlize Theron.  And the 54-year-old looked as smitten as ever on Sunday, as the pair, along with Charlize's three-year-old son Jackson, landed at JFK airport in New York City.  The two were seen affectionately holding hands as they made their way through the arrivals lounge, staying close even while waiting for their rides to come.  The Mad Max: Fury Road star showed off a radiant glow, wearing minimal make-up as her blonde locks were swept back and eyes were concealed with black sunglasses.  Sean was a bit more edgy, wearing a grey shirt, black bomber jacket, dark denim trousers, and brown shoes.  Jackson stood out in a patterned blue jacket, printed T-shirt, green trousers and pink shoes.  The threesome's outing comes following reports that Sean has put his Malibu home, which he purchased after his divorce from Robin Wright, on the market in order to begin a new journey with Charlize.  'I'm in love with a woman and home is where the heart is, right?' he said in a candid interview with Esquire.  Married twice before to Madonna and Robin, the Gangster Squad star said that he never expected to be in love at his age.  After dating the Monster star for almost a year, the actor is reportedly going to adopt her son Jackson and relocate to another property in the same area.  'I'm in love with my children,' he said, 'Jackson's very committed here with schools and all that.  'Charlize has friends and family here. And there are upsides and conveniences that come with being here.'  Meanwhile, Charlize has recently been promoting her latest action thriller, Mad Max: Fury Road, and Sean can currently be seen in The Gunman. \",\n 'Ben Affleck Has Reportedly Started Training For The Batman  If you have been worried about Ben Affleck\u2019s place in the DC Extended Universe, then you can breathe a sigh of relief. Over the last few months, fans of the actor\u2019s take on the Gotham vigilante have grow increasingly worried about whether Affleck would return to the role. A series of blips concerning Batman\u2019s impending standalone movie were enough to make the most confident of fans second-guess Affleck\u2019s longterm commitment to Batfleck. In fact, some were even worried the actor would back out of The Batman entirely after Affleck stepped down as director.  But, if one inside scoop has anything to say, then Affleck is still down to reprise Bruce Wayne for the solo venture.  Earlier today, noted DC Comics insider Umberto Gonzalez dropped some Batman scoop in an episode of Heroic Insider. It was there the reporter said Affleck has started a new training regiment to get him ready for The Batman. \u201cBen Affleck, Batman, I just got word that he just started training again for the role. You know how there was talk that he was gonna leave and he might leave the role? Nah, bro. He\u2019s working out. He\u2019s getting back in shape,\u201d Gonzalez told fans.  Of course, there is no official confirmation about whether Affleck\u2019s new workout schedule adheres to such a promise. Still, it seems more and more likely that Affleck will return to the superhero role. Excitement for Justice League continues to mount ahead of its fall premiere this year, and the introduce of Matt Reeves to The Batman has fans fired up as well. In a recent interview with Daily News, the director admitted he\u2019s been a Batman fanboy for years, and Reeves seems partial to Affleck\u2019s darker take on the character.  \u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing to be involved in the two franchises which were the two that I was connected to most as a child,\u201d Reeves said. \u201cI just was obsessed with Batman when I was a kid. What I find so interesting about him as a character is that, as far a superhero goes, he\u2019s not superhuman, he is a person. And he is a tortured soul who is grappling with his past and trying to find a way to be in a world that has a lot that\u2019s wrong with it and trying to find a way to reconcile all of that.\u201d In Justice League, fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman\u2019s selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes\u2014Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash\u2014it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.   Justice League is directed by Zack Snyder, from a screenplay by Chris Terrio, based on a story by Snyder and Terrio, and stars Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher, Amy Adams, Willem Dafoe, Jesse Eisenberg, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, J. K. Simmons, and Ciar\u00e1n Hinds. ',\n 'Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux Made One \"Massive Miscalculation\" While Planning Their Secret Wedding  Uncomfortable seating aside, it sounded as though Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux\\'s secret wedding, this summer, went off without a hitch. Incredibly, details about the Malibu nuptials were not leaked to press. Jimmy Kimmel did a \"beautiful\" job ordaining the ceremony, finding the perfect balance between sweet and funny. Howard Stern gave a speech. And afterward, the newlyweds embarked on the fanciest group honeymoon of which we\\'ve ever heard. But on Wednesday, while promoting the new season of HBO\\'s The Leftovers, Theroux revealed that the duo did make one \"massive miscalculation\" when planning the wedding.  Theroux explained that, to keep the wedding below-the-radar, he and Aniston told different guests different reasons why they were throwing a party at their house this past August. Initially, they told most guests it was a birthday celebration for Theroux. But when certain people R.S.V.P.\\'d no because of busy schedules, the couple felt the need to spill the secret to entice them to be there on the special day. Of course, that meant that the in-the-know guests were dressed like they were attending a wedding, while the rest were in jeans and flip flops, so that each guest could easily tell who had been trusted with the secret and who hadn\\'t.  \"It was actually a massive miscalculation,\" Theroux said of their wedding plan. \"Afterwards, we kind of realized, like, that was a terrible plan, because you\\'re basically telling half your guests, \\'You\\'re unemployed and we can\\'t trust you,\\' which was of course not the case, but we just kind of put it out there, and people that said yes to the birthday [we didn\\'t tell], and then people who said, \\'We can\\'t,\\' we really put more pressure on them to be at the \\'birthday.\\'\"  And then, of course, there were also the friends who, during Theroux and Aniston\\'s engagement, just got into the habit of dressing in formal wear each time they were invited to the couple\\'s home in the off-chance that the get-together would turn out to be the couple\\'s much-anticipated wedding.  \"We also have friends who, when we\\'ve done barbecues and stuff, show up, like, dressed to the nines, like, \\'This is the thing, right?,\\'\" Theroux said. \"And we\\'re like, \\'No, this is actually just a barbecue.\\'\"  On a happier note, though, Theroux said he is relishing the fact that he is finally able to call Aniston his wife. \"The first couple days of doing it-it\\'s a great feeling.\" ',\n 'Anna Faris Responds To Chris Pratt-Jennifer Lawrence Cheating Rumors As They Promote \\'Passengers\\' On Her Birthday  \"Mom\" actress Anna Faris didn\\'t want to let the tabloids get to her, but when rumors swirled last year about husband Chris Pratt cheated on her with \"Passengers\" co-star Jennifer Lawrence, she felt vulnerable.  \"Chris and I, we talk about this a lot,\" Faris, 40, said about gossip on her podcast, \"Anna Faris Is Unqualified,\" Thursday. \"We grapple with a lot of the ideas of being a public couple.\"  Even though she wanted to brush it off, she couldn\\'t. \"I just remember feeling so hurt in a way that bothered me, because I didn\\'t want to think of myself as somebody who could be affected by ... tabloid s--t,\" Faris recalled.  It was a \"combination\" of things that bothered Faris. \"I take pride in how great my relationship is with Chris, but having said that, of course, in this crazy world where he\\'s off doing movies and I\\'m in L.A. raising our child, of course I\\'m going to feel vulnerable, like any normal human would,\" she said. \"It made me feel incredibly insecure\" even though the rumors weren\\'t true.  It\\'s not the first time Faris talked about the rumors. She opened up to \\xa0Us Weekly\\xa0at the August TCA Stars Party. \"[That] stung a little bit harder than I thought it would,\" Faris admitted about Lawrence, 24. \"I thought, \\'Maybe there is a kernel of truth to that.\\'\"  But Faris was able to make light of the situation. She joked about being jealous of Pratt\\'s \"Jurassic World\" co-star, Blue, the dinosaur. \"Honey, what if I\\'m the littlest jealous of Blue? I mean, she\\'s hot, smart, and you clearly adore her-thoughts?\" she tweeted in June 2015.  Even though Lawrence and Pratt, 37, were promoting their science fiction thriller over Faris\\' birthday, Pratt made sure to wish his wife a happy birthday. \"Please join me in wishing Happy Birthday to my darling @AnnaKFaris I\\'m sending you love from afar, beautiful lady,\" he wrote Tuesday. The post was liked more than 12,000 times by his 3.82 million Twitter followers.  Pratt and Faris married in 2009. They are parents to 4-year-old son, Jack.

Um... some have.  Kendall and Kylie Jenner posed alongside Caitlyn at an event on Father\\'s Day, but if their social media is any indication, the girls weren\\'t particularly keen on celebrating the holiday. Meanwhile, mom Kris Jenner created a photo college of all the special dads in her life: Kanye, Rob, Scott and the late Robert Sr. Notice anyone missing?  Caitlyn and her daughters posed for a photo together at the Rodeo Drive Concours d\\' Elegance in Beverly Hills on Sunday, and they looked like a happy family, pet dog and all. (By the way, whose dog is this? Kendall only held her for one photo.) But social media told a different story.  Despite the serene-looking professional photo, there\\'s clearly still some animosity within the family. Neither Kendall nor Kylie acknowledged Caitlyn on social media, even though they were both actively posting: Kylie shared a pic of herself and Kendall, but Caitlyn is nowhere to be seen. Later, she posted another photo from the event, captioning it \"daddy\\'s day\" -- but again, no Caitlyn. Kendall also shared a photo on Father\\'s Day, but it had nothing to do with the holiday.  For her part, Caitlyn did share a version of the above photo, writing, \"Good day at the Father\\'s Day car show on Rodeo Drive with my girls. Happy Father\\'s Day to all the dads out there.\"  Meanwhile, mom Kris Jenner made a strong statement with her very telling Instagram collage. The Kardashian matriarch wrote a lengthy caption celebrating all the dads, but there\\'s not even the slightest nod to Bruce or Caitlyn. Kendall and Kylie are not in the collage, but all her other children and grandchildren are.  Plenty of fans called out the snub, writing comments like \"Where\\'s Caitlyn??\" and \"The sun may be out, but there\\'s plenty of shade here.\"  Just another day in the Kardashian-Jenner world. ',\n 'Stop Right Now! The Spice Girls Might Be Planning A Reunion  There are certain things that people just shouldn\\'t joke about. A potential Spice Girls reunion with all five members is one of them.  Earlier this morning, news broke that the most iconic girlband of all time may be reuniting in 2018, sending chills down the spines of every 90s girl power advocate up and down the country.  According to the Independent, Mel C has reportedly been working quietly with the band\\'s former boss Simon Fuller over the past few months to bring Victoria Beckham, Mel B, Emma Bunton and Geri Horner (n\u00e9e Halliwell) back for the one-off special, with a compilation record expected to land next year.  A source told The Sun: \\'The five of them have been locked in secret talks since the summer, and finally they are all on-board for a 2018 reunion.  \\'As it stands, they will be working together on a series of projects, which will include an album and a TV special celebrating the Spice Girls - and getting Victoria to agree has been a coup for everyone involved, given she has always been the person holding back on a reunion.\\'  But alas, Spice Girls fans, we need to stay rational about this.  Put away the platform trainers and ask yourself, \\'would Victoria actually agree to this?\\'  Let us present an analysis...  Although many a source is reporting that Scary, Baby, Sporty, Ginger and Posh are set to make a comeback next year, we mustn\\'t forget the numerous times that Beckham has staunchly opposed a Spice reunion.  It was only earlier this year that ex-Posh Spice turned fashion mogul told U.S. breakfast show The Today Show that \\'there won\\'t be a reunion because I think that when we performed at the Olympics, it was so great, and that was us celebrating everything that we\\'d achieved\\'.  She then went on to say: \\'I still talk to all the other girls, we\\'re still very close, but I think you need to know when it\\'s time to actually say, \"That was great, we achieved a lot,\" and everybody moves on.\\'  A new album doesn\\'t sound much like moving on, does it?  Understandably, Victoria now has a family and a thriving business in the fashion industry to look after and, in the past, has cited these commitments as her reasoning for not wanting to reunite with her bandmates.  All hope is not lost, however, as, when asked about a potential Spice Girls reunion, Mel C was previously quoted on The Nightly Show saying: \\'I kind of feel like it\\'s not really doing the band justice to go out as a four piece, whoever\\'s missing it doesn\\'t matter.\\'  So, surely if there were to be some kind of reunion it must involve all five original members... right?  Dare we believe the rumours that all five have been in \\'secret talks\\' over the summer and are on board? Should we really raise our hopes that high?  Whatever the case, the Spice Girls will always \\'Viva Forever\\' in our hearts.

The singer talked about her marriage at a screening Wednesday for her new visual album, \"Double Dutchess,\" at iPic Theaters Fulton Market in New York.

',\n ' Inside Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner\\'s Family Vacation in the Bahamas, Two Months After Filing for Divorce  It\\'s been two months since Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner officially filed for divorce (and two years since they announced their separation), but they still make sure to spend quality time together with their three children, Violet, Samuel and Seraphina.   Case in point: The whole family vacationed in Baker\\'s Bay last week.  \"Ben and Jen took a family vacation with other family friends,\" an insider tells E!

All the dads went along, and it would have been strange for the kids not to have their dad there.\" If Baker\\'s Bay sounds familiar, that\\'s because it\\'s the same Caribbean island the family visited after they announced their separation in 2015. But they\\'ve been going there for years, even before that.  Of course, with the vacation comes plenty of speculation regarding their relationship status. However, our insider confirms, \"They are not getting back together at all. They are both moving on, but will continue doing things together as a family.\"  We\\'re told Ben wasn\\'t there the entire time. Rather, he came for a few days toward the end of the trip.  As for the getaway, another source dished, \"They stayed in the same house they always stay at. It\\'s beachfront and beautiful. It\\'s an annual tradition for them when the kids get out of school to come for a long vacation. It\\'s very relaxing, and they can feel like they\\'re on island time with nowhere to go and nobody they need to see.\"  So what did they do?  Our insider added, \"The kids spent a lot of time on the beach swimming and playing in the sand with their friends. They also swam in the pool at the house and visited the club. Ben and Jen both worked out at the gym daily.\"  The former couple has always been very vocal that co-parenting their three children is their No.1 priority, and they will remain united as a team to do so.  \"We are definitely a modern family,\" Jen told Today last summer. \"You don\\'t have a choice,\" she added, admitting that while their new normal might look unusual to some, they\\'re actually \"doing really well.\" Ben reiterated that statement when he told E!

During the season premiere, the revamped \"View\" cast, which now includes Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace, introduced themselves and caught the audience up on their lives.  For Whoopi Goldberg and Rosie O\\'Donnell, some of their big news included new physiques. Goldberg has shed 35 pounds, and O\\'Donnell, who previously co-hosted \"The View\" in 2006 and 2007, has lost more than 50 pounds.  \"I\\'m good, I\\'m happy since you saw me last,\" O\\'Donnell told \"The View\" audience Monday. \"I got married, I have a new baby. ... I lost 50-something pounds with surgery because I had a heart attack two years ago. I had the vertical gastric sleeve -- if you\\'re morbidly obese, it can save your life.\"  When it was Goldberg\\'s turn, she admitted that she, too, has \"lost a little weight.\"  \"I ended up weighing 217 pounds, which was way too much of me for anyone,\" Goldberg quipped.  Former \"View\" star Sherri Shepherd, who left the program in August, inspired Goldberg, 58, to get in better shape.  \"I happened to notice that I had begun to look like a linebacker,\" Goldberg told ABC News backstage. \"I happened to look over and there was Sherri (Shepherd), skinny, and I said, \\'What did you do?\\' She said, \\'I\\'ve been doing Rocco DiSpirito\\'s one pound a day diet.\\' I said, \\'Please, I want to do it too.\\' \"  O\\'Donnell, who first shared her weight-loss success in April, told ABC News that the change hasn\\'t been easy.  \"The fact that I look so different has been difficult and unexpected,\" the 52-year-old said. \"Everyone assumes that obese people would just be jumping for joy that they were healthier and thinner and able to fit into store-bought sizes, we don\\'t have to go to the plus store. But it\\'s also filled with a lot of emotional turbulence, you wouldn\\'t expect.\"  ',\n 'The Queen \\'will not step aside for Prince Charles\\', sources say  The Queen has no intention of stepping aside for Prince Charles and\\xa0remains committed to her duty to the nation, it has been reported.  The 91-year-old sovereign is the world\\'s longest-reigning living monarch but as she pledged on her 21st birthday, she insists on\\xa0serving the\\xa0country for her whole life.  But despite speculation she may step aside to let Prince Charles take the throne,\\xa0royal insiders told The Sunday Times the Queen had\\xa0stated\\xa0\"duty first, nation first, I\\'m going to be there\".  Three separate senior sources have dismissed claims she will request the Regency Act, which allows the monarch to cede power to the heir and see a regent carrying out certain royal functions and duties on behalf of the sovereign.  For the Act to be requested, the monarch has to be officially declared incapable of performing royal functions by the lord chancellor, the Speaker of the House of Commons and the master of rolls.  But the sources have quashed rumours the Queen would step aside if she was still on the throne in four years time.  One source\\xa0told the newspaper\\xa0the Queen had\\xa0always been vehement that she would\\xa0not call for a regency, adding: \"As long as she\\'s healthy, regardless of her age, I don\\'t see a regency. Other members of the royal family can just do more.\"  In recent years, she\\xa0has reduced the number of public engagements she attends but\\xa0continues to carry out her functions on state matters.  She\\xa0no longer makes long haul overseas trips\\xa0and other members of the royal family have been undertaking foreign tours and official state visits in her name.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince William and Kate, for example caught the world\\'s attention during the Diamond Jubilee Tour on behalf of the Queen in September 2012.  There have\\xa0also been discussions about the possibility of the crown \"leapfrogging\" Prince Charles in favour of his son Prince William.  But this has been dismissed since it would cause\\xa0a constitutional crisis, with Prince William previously saying there was \"no question\" of it happening.  Speaking in 2012 about his future on the throne, Prince Charles, 68,\\xa0said: \"Impatient? Me? What a thing to suggest! Yes of course I am. I\\'ll run out of time soon. I shall have snuffled it if I\\'m not careful\".  Keen to engage in public life, Prince Charles has depicted himself as a champion of environmental issues. ',\n 'Nicole Kidman Charmingly Bungles Through a Comment on Her Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd Kiss at the Emmys  Ah, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. She, an Australian film fixture once married to Hollywood\u2019s leading man. He, an Australian country singer with a Nashville heart. Together they are a bi-coastal, bi-country, bi-continent power couple. Go on, watch them walk down any red carpet together and try to remain uncharmed. They\u2019re two charm factories who make distinctive hair choices! You have no chance! That\u2019s why when she won best actress for her electric Big Little Lies role, and kissed her television husband, the very tall Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, on the lips while her actual husband looked lovingly on, everyone was like, \u201cWhat? Huh? On the lips?\u201d  Finally, we have some answers. Sort of. Well, Graham Norton of Britain\u2019s Graham Norton Show tried to get some answers, while Kidman sat next to her Killing of a Sacred Deer co-star Colin Farrell, who was next to Bryan Cranston, who was next to Matt Lucas. He didn\u2019t get answers, per se, but he did get some TV magic.  \u201cI kissed my husband too,\u201d was her first tactic. And then, she said, \u201cI did kiss him because\u2014 but you gotta understand, I did everything with Alex,\" Nicole said.  \u201cAlright I\u2019m backin\u2019 off,\u201d Kidman said. \u201cI\u2019ve got an amazing, supportive, gorgeous husband who I love more than anything in the world and I gave Alex a congratulatory kiss and he\u2019s like a mannequin.\u201d  The clip is charming. Kidman\u2019s charming. She, one of the most beautiful and accomplished women in the world, can\u2019t say the right thing no matter how hard she tries. She\u2019s awash is embarrassment, but also it feels so safe because the couple\u2014Kidman and Urban, that is\u2014appears to have so much love that that love bubbles up and over, turning an innocent congratulations into a kiss on the lips. There\u2019s enough to go around, it would seem.  This year, Kidman has developed a habit of doing a small thing at an award show that becomes a much bigger phenomenon on the Internet that night and the following day, and, in the case of the Skarsg\u00e5rd kiss, the subsequent weeks. She\u2019s a one-woman meme machine, and who could have seen that coming? Who could have thought that in 2017, Nicole Kidman would be the one bringing unintentional levity to long award shows? Anyone?  One of those small things was just being cute on the Cannes red carpet with her husband. (He whispered something, but we\u2019ll never know what it is. It\u2019s Lost in Translation 2: Still a Little Lost!) Another time she clapped like a seal at the Oscars. (It was a strategy, she explained, for showing appreciation while also protecting the diamonds.) We\u2019ll have to wait and see what kind of nominations Kidman racks up for the imminent awards season, but we can only hope the people in charge of seating charts place her firmly in front of a camera. She\u2019s a proven star in this new ad-hoc people\u2019s choice category. ',\n 'Jennifer Aniston dashes \\'Friends\\' reunion hopes  Jennifer Aniston has once again broken hearts by shooting down the possibility of a \"Friends\" reunion.  In an interview with ITV, the actress talked about looking back with fondness on working on the beloved, hit NBC series.  \"Not only was it a gift for us, but it\\'s something people have been able to carry with them,\" Aniston said. \"It\\'s comfort food and it makes them feel better when they are feeling down, when they want to distract themselves.\"  And to answer the question that always seems to come up -- will there be a reunion? -- Aniston said don\\'t count on it.  \"I don\\'t know what we would do,\" she said. \"I think that period of time was sort of nostalgic, you know?\" \"There\\'s something about a time where our faces weren\\'t shoved into cell phones and we weren\\'t, like, checking Facebooks and Instagrams, and we were in a room together -- or at a coffee shop together -- and we were talking,\" she added. \"And we\\'ve lost that.\" But they can still \"be there for you\" in syndication, so hold tight to that. You can, however, see Aniston on the big screen when her latest film \"Office Christmas Party\" opens December 9. ',\n 'Is Prince Harry Headed To Yale?  NOT since Prince William chose St Andrews as his alma mater has such fevered excitement existed on a university campus, but students hoping to end up sharing a dorm with a prince will have to look a little further afield this time as rumours emerge that Prince Harry is Yale-bound. The 31-year-old royal is thought to be considering Yale Law School in Connecticut as his next move after leaving the army, and the students are understandably excited \"Everyone was talking about it around the campus. Big buzz!\" one student told Page Six, while another on-campus source added: \"Yale would be over the moon to get Harry as a student. Imagine the kind of fundraising they could do.\"   No stranger to fundraising himself, Prince Harry launched the Invictus Games in 2014 - a Paralympic-style sporting event for injured servicemen and women - and also works with charities working to support children with HIV/Aids and with African-based charities focused on the conservation of endangered species.  The prince, who graduated from the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, has served two tours of duty in Afghanistan as a helicopter pilot, but could - like elder brother Prince William - be looking for a secondary career before he assumes royal life full time. ',\n 'Jennifer Aniston sparks adoption rumors  Before you go, we thought you\\'d like these...  Is Jennifer Aniston ready to become a mommy?  Much to the dismay of fans everywhere, rumors that the 47-year-old actress is getting ready to adopt a child of her own after becoming closely involved with two orphanages in Mexico have been quickly destroyed.  Aniston prompted speculation after reportedly becoming a regular visitor at Casa Hogar Sion and Casa Hogar de Los Ninos orphanages in Tijuana, Mexico.  The former \"Friends\" star tied the knot with actor Justin Theroux in a secret ceremony in 2015. Many claims have surfaced about a possible bun in the oven since then, but the couple has been quick to deny the claims.  \"For the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up,\" she wrote in a strongly worded essay back in July.  She revealed to Marie Claire last week that she wrote the op-ed because she refused to \"be whittled down to a sad, childless human.\"  Pregnancy talks have followed the celebrity throughout her career, especially after some speculated her resistance to having kids destroyed her five-year marriage with Brad Pitt.  And it seems like she\\'s not fazed by the swirling rumors -- she was recently spotted with her beau in Berlin packing on some major PDA.

Over the past few weeks, rumors have made the rounds that Shelton is cheating on his wife, possibly with actress Lindsay Sporrer, with whom he attended Usher\\'s birthday party. But, in his typical unabashed manner, the singer chose to put a stop to the chatter in the best possible way -- by \"embracing\" the reports, and then making a mockery of them.  Shelton took to Twitter yesterday to write to his over four million followers:  Shelton had previously commented on being a tabloid fixture, telling \"CBS This Morning\": \"I love it. I honestly do love it. I just know, to have that kind of coverage, if I\\'m popular enough they want to put me and Miranda on that stuff -- that\\'s awesome. I have an album coming out!

Daytime legends Regis Philbin, Marie Osmond, Charo, Tom Bergeron and Fred Willard came together to honor the 93-year-old superstar.  \"I can\\'t tell you what this means,\" Betty told the crowd when discussing her career that started in 1949. \"I had no idea that I would still be alive at this point for one thing, but I\\'d still be privileged enough to still be in this business.\"  VIDEO: Matt Lauer and Ellen DeGeneres\\' pranks end at the Daytime Emmys    ',\n 'Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth wore wedding rings on \\'SNL\\' \u2014 and now fans are convinced they got married  The couple were in a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch together. Saturday Night Live/YouTube  Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth have sparked some speculation that they got secretly married after stepping out with rings on their fingers in late October, and the engaged couple continued to fan the flames on \"Saturday Night Live.\"  Cyrus, 24, performed two songs as the musical guest on Saturday\\'s episode of the NBC sketch show. Her ring finger was especially noticeable during \"I Would Die For You,\" her second performance of the night.  Miley is still sporting two rings. Saturday Night Live/NBC  Hemsworth, 27, surprised fans with a cameo in a \"The Price Is Right\" sketch earlier in the night, but his left hand was covered throughout the whole thing. But at the end of the evening, as everyone clapped and said good night, a band could be spotted on his ring finger.  Some eagle-eyed fans spotted the rings on their fingers.  Now, this isn\\'t the first time both have stepped out with bling on their ring fingers.  Back in August 2017, Hemsworth was spotted with the gold band on his finger, but sources told E! News that the ring was worn as a \"\\'promise\\' to Miley.\" As for Cyrus\\' rings, she began wearing her engagement ring that Hemsworth first proposed with in 2012 after the two reconciled in 2016. She was spotted with a second ring on the finger in October, according to Glamour.  But Cyrus has spoken about her views on marriage, and doesn\\'t seem too keen on tying the knot just yet.  In a recent interview with The Sun on Sunday, according to a report from The Daily Mail, Cyrus said she wants to wait a bit before getting married.  \"I don\\'t envision marriage. I\\'m 24. I hope I get to live a little bit more,\" she said. \"I have too much living to do [before I get married]. I have no idea what the next three years will bring, but if it\\'s possible to get even happier, I\\'ll take it.\"  For an in-depth look at their whirlwind romance, read our relationship timeline.  ',\n 'Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber Just Kissed at His Hockey Game  As The Weeknd reconnects with his ex, Bella Hadid, Selena Gomez continues her string of appearances with Justin Bieber. Last night, she supported the Canadian pop star at his hockey game in LA (for the second time). And the two took the PDA to the next level: they were spotted kissing at the rink.  Though the two haven\\'t personally confirmed the reports that they\\'re back together, this marks the first time they\\'ve been seen kissing since they started hanging out again.  Gomez also had some company\u2014she brought along the puppy she and The Weeknd got together. She carried around the pup, Charlie, and played with him in the rink as Bieber took the ice.  Selena just adopted the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel in September. She and her then-boyfriend, The Weeknd (AKA Abel Tesfaye) were spotted at a New York City pet store playing with the dog before taking him home. Since then, Charlie occasionally tagged along for the former couple\\'s candid appearances. It looks like Selena got custody of the pet after she and Tesfaye broke up at the end of October.  In recent weeks, Gomez and Bieber have made numerous joint public appearances, which began even before it was announced that she split with the R&B star. One sighting also took place at one of Bieber\\'s hockey games, which took place just two days after Gomez and Tesfaye\\'s breakup was reported. During that appearance, Gomez cheered on Bieber from the stands, and later left with him while wearing his hockey jersey. There was also this cute PDA moment:  For last night\\'s game, however, she drove home alone (except Charlie was also in the car).  Bieber and Gomez are reportedly back together, but despite the frequent joint appearances, sources say the couple is trying to take it slow. \"They just backed off a little from being out there and are being a bit more low-key,\" sources told People.    Whether or not The Weeknd is trying to rekindle is old romance with Bella Hadid, Gomez seems completely unbothered.

The 35-year-old actress appeared on the red carpet on Wednesday (May 24) in support of of film The Beguiled alongside co-stars Elle Fanning, Nicole Kidman, Colin Farrell and director Sofia Coppola.  While it should be a happy occasion as you\u2019re endlessly snapped by hungry photographers, people were left baffled as Kirsten strutted the aisle in uncontrollable tears.  However it seems the tears can be explained, with Kirsten\u2019s rep telling Metro.co.uk the outburst happened due to the overwhelming matter of sharing the carpet with Coppola.  Speaking to Metro.co.uk, a rep said: \u2018She was just moved to be back at Cannes with her friend and director Sofia.

The actress\u2019s wedding to CollegeHumor co-founder Ricky Van Veen took place at a Wyoming ranch on Saturday, and so far\u2014like a true Millennial\u2014all she\u2019s shared about the big event is this Instagram, featuring her custom Oscar de la Renta gown.  People had more details, including that Tom Hanks was the officiant (his wife Rita Wilson plays Marnie\u2019s mom on Girls) and other guests included Katy Perry, John Mayer, Bruce Springsteen, Seth Meyers, Diane von Furstenberg, Barry Diller, Mindy Kaling, and of course, Girls co-stars Lena Dunham and Jemima Kirke. Dunham\u2019s Instagram included some shots of the road trip to and from the Wyoming ranch, but none of the event itself.  If Williams were more like her Girls character, we could probably expect an entire album of weepy singer-songwriter tracks about the big day. But the real Williams, thankfully, will probably celebrate much more like a normal person\u2014and hopefully share a few more Instagrams for the rest of us whose invitations were surely lost in the mail.

But at the end of 2013, Bieber admits the two aren\u2019t speaking , although he still loves her.  2014\u2014Are They or Aren\u2019t They?  2014, to put it lightly, was a confusing year in the Jelena timeline . First of all, it\u2019s the year that Bieber\u2019s image goes full-on bad boy\u2014after bizarre incidents in 2013, like peeing in a bucket and losing custody of his monkey\u2014he gets in real, tangible trouble. In January alone, he\u2019s arrested for drunk driving, resisting arrest, and driving without a valid license, and he was also accused of vandalism for egging his neighbors. (January isn\u2019t great for Gomez, either, who checks into rehab .) The tabloids viciously suggest it\u2019s because of Bieber and/or a drug problem, but a frustrated Gomez later tells GQ that it was to seek help for lupus.  But before the rehab and before the DUI, the couple is spotted riding Segways in Calabasas, California . Throughout the year, and all the drama, the \u201cmaybe dates\u201d continue: a Starbucks run in Texas and a day at the zoo. Then, the Instagram\u2014Bieber posts (and also deletes) a bunch of pictures of his former beau, including one that calls their love \u201cunconditional.\u201d  But concurrently woven in those sightings are other ones . . . with Bieber and other women. He\u2019s associated with a slew of models, up-and-coming actresses, and other beauties\u2014including Kendall and Kylie Jenner, who Gomez at one point reportedly unfollows on Instagram , and she also unfollowed Bieber.  Then there\u2019s the international incident in July 2014, when Orlando Bloom and Justin Bieber get into fist fight , allegedly over Gomez.  In November, Gomez releases \u201cThe Heart Wants What It Wants,\u201d which she suggests is about Bieber. She gives an emotional performance of the song at the American Music Awards, which some signal to mean the relationship has finally run its course. That same month, Bieber unfollows her on Instagram . In December, he posts a picture of himself with Hailey Baldwin, but in the caption says he\u2019s \u201csuper single.\u201d  2015\u2014Are They or Aren\u2019t They? (Part Two)  We\u2019re entering the second of the lost Jelena years, where no one knows quite what\u2019s going on, perhaps not even the Bieber and Gomez themselves.  After being spotted holding hands at a Golden Globes party, Gomez and Zedd enjoy a brief romance. Zedd admits two years later to Billboard that he wasn\u2019t ready to date an international superstar like Gomez: \u201cReporters were calling my parents. People were hacking my friends\u2019 phones. I was pissed. [Though] I kind of knew what I was getting myself into,\u201d he said.  Bieber continues to post throwback pictures of Gomez on Instagram, confusing just about everyone\u2014 including Drake . Reconciliation rumors ramp up after he tells Ellen DeGeneres that a number of songs on his new album Purpose are about Gomez, and a video surfaces of Bieber serenading her with \u201cMy Girl\u201d at a hotel in Beverly Hills.  But Gomez makes it clear she\u2019s sick of being defined by their relationship. In her cover story with Elle , she says her November 2014 AMA performance was her personal life swan song. \u201cEverybody was talking about the same thing: my relationship,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI was so exhausted. I said, \u2018I want this [performance] to be the last time I have to talk about this. And acknowledge this feeling.\u2019 \u201d  Early 2016\u2014Here We Go Again  In January 2016, Justin Bieber posts steamy pictures with Hailey Baldwin in St. Barth\u2019s , which many take to mean they are dating. The speculation increases when Baldwin makes a cameo in Bieber\u2019s GQ cover story. He describes her as \u201csomeone I really love. We spend a lot of time together.\u201d  However, Baldwin later tells Marie Claire that they weren\u2019t ever official. \u201cWe are not an exclusive couple. He\u2019s about to go on tour,\u201d she said. \u201cRelationships at this age are already complicated, but I don\u2019t really like to talk about it because it\u2019s between me and him.\u201d  Bieber posts a throwback picture of him and Gomez kissing, and she comments \u201cperfect.\u201d  Although claiming they\u2019re just friends , Bieber posts a series of Instagrams with Sofia Richie. However, after backlash from fans, Bieber posted \u201cI\u2019m gonna make my Instagram private if you guys don\u2019t stop the hate this is getting out of hand, if you guys are really fans you wouldn\u2019t be so mean to people that I like.\u201d  Gomez responded in the comments section: \u201cIf you can\u2019t handle the hate then stop posting pictures of your girlfriend lol\u2014it should be special between you two only. Don\u2019t be mad at your fans. They love you.\u201d  That, allegedly, kicked off a full-on Instagram war between the couple, involving many comments, including cheating accusations on both sides, which are now said to be deleted. Gomez later takes to her Snapchat to say that what she did was \u201cselfish and pointless.\u201d Bieber deletes his Instagram.  A few months later, it's reported that Gomez cut her Revival Tour short to seek treatment at a facility in Tennessee. \u201cMy self-esteem was shot. I was depressed, anxious. I started to have panic attacks right before getting onstage, or right after leaving the stage. Basically I felt I wasn\u2019t good enough, wasn\u2019t capable,\u201d she later told Vogue.  Gomez and The Weeknd hit the red carpet couple together at the 2017 Met Gala.  Gomez reveals on Instagram that she underwent a kidney transplant. (The donor was her friend Francia Raisa.)  Bieber and Gomez are seen hanging out together again , but multiple sources say it\u2019s just as friends. Allegedly, their church, Hillsong, as well as Gomez\u2019s kidney transplant caused to two to reconnect. And The Weeknd was reportedly fine with it.  However, just about a week after the reports, Selena Gomez and The Weeknd announce their split (although, apparently, Bieber was not the cause).  In the weeks following Gomez\u2019s breakup with The Weeknd, she's spotted canoodling with Bieber. . . again and again and again. On November 15, they kiss at his hockey game\u2014fueling tabloid speculation that they are back together and better than ever.  Maybe, or maybe not. Because if this timeline has taught you anything, dear reader, it should be that at this point, the truth is anybody\u2019s guess. \",\n 'http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/taylor-swift-new-song-look-what-you-made-me-do-apparent-kanye-west-diss-w499090 Taylor Swift Releases Apparent Kanye West Diss Song 2017-08-24 Taylor Swift is not ready to make nice on \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" the biting lead single of her highly anticipated sixth album, Reputation. Jack Antonoff, who worked with Swift on her last album, 1989, co-wrote and co-produced the dance-pop song, which includes an interpolation of Right Said Fred\\'s \"I\\'m Too Sexy.\"  \"I don\\'t like your little games/ I don\\'t like your tilted stage,\" Swift viciously sings. \"The role you made me play: of the fool/ No, I don\\'t like you.\" Later, she sings, \"The world moves on / Another day another drama, drama / But not for me, Not for me / All I think about is karma.\"  Towards the end of the song, Swift uses an effect that approximates singing through a phone. \"The old Taylor can\\'t come to the phone right now,\" she says. \"Why?/ \\'Cause she\\'s dead.\"   While not mentioning Kanye West by name, the song\\'s lyrics (West notably used a tilted stage on his recent Saint Pablo tour) alongside the phone voice appear to reference her long, public feud with the rapper. The beef was revived last year after West\\'s song \"Famous\" included the lyric: \"I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/ Why? I made that bitch famous.\" West\\'s accompanying video feature Swift\\'s likeness naked in bed with other naked celebrities. Swift denounced the song upon its release, taking issue with being called a \"bitch\" and West taking credit for her success. Months later, West\\'s wife Kim Kardashian leaked video and audio of West and Swift\\'s phone conversation, seemingly confirming that Swift was aware of some of West\\'s lyrics about her in private. There was no recording, however, of Swift listening to and approving \"I made that bitch famous.\"    Taylor Swift vs. Kanye West: A Beef History From \"I\\'mma let you finish\" to \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" we recap pop\\'s most high-profile feud After the song\\'s release, certain listeners questioned the timing of the album, as Swift\\'s November 10th release date lands on the same day as the 10th anniversary of the death of Kanye West\\'s mother Donda. A source at Big Machine Records, Swift\\'s record label, however, denies any correlation to Rolling Stone. \"It is standard practice that releases come out on Fridays and we locked in this release date based on other Universal Music Group releases,\" the source says. \"There is no correlation.\"  Prior to \"Famous,\" Swift and West made amends both publicly and privately following their initial rumble at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards where West hijacked the stage during Swift\\'s acceptance speech for Best Female Video to say that Beyonc\u00e9 should have won. The gaffe was so shocking, even President Barack Obama weighed in, calling West \"a jackass\" for interrupting the singer. Swift\\'s Speak Now ballad \"Innocent\" is about that event. \"I think a lot of people expected me to write a song about [West],\" she told MTV at the time. \"But, for me, it was important to write a song to him.\"  Reputation will be released on November 10th and is available for pre-order. Swift has partnered with Target to release two 72-page magazines alongside the album that will include \"personal poetry and photos, artwork by Taylor, handwritten lyrics, exclusive poster\" and photos from the \"Look What You Made Me Do\" video shoot.    While the singer-songwriter has yet to reveal specific tour dates, she also announced a partnership with Ticketmaster Verified Fan, a new program that attempts to block scalpers and bots from obtaining tickets. The singer also released a video explaining the process.  Since wrapping her 1989 world tour at the end of 2015, Swift took on more background roles in music. She co-wrote Little Big Town\\'s \"Better Man\" and Calvin Harris\\' \"This Is What You Came For,\" which features Rihanna on lead vocals. She also collaborated with Zayn Malik on the hit song \"I Don\\'t Wanna Live Forever,\" from the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack.   ',\n ' James Corden just asked Kim Kardashian about the Khloe and Kylie pregnancy rumours 2017-11-16 08:52:00 Two months after rumours broke out that both Kylie Jenner and sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian might be pregnant at the same time, we still don\\'t know any more than we did in September. Big sis Kim Kardashian won\\'t be ending the suspense any time soon, judging by her recent appearance on James Corden.  Kim took part in a particularly nasty game of \"Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts,\" a staple of the Corden show where James and a guest ask each other questions that could get them in trouble. If one of the players refuses to answer, they have to eat a gut-churning ~delicacy~.  When asked to rank her mum and sisters from best to worst dressed, Kim didn\\'t hesitate to oblige \u2014 understandable, since the alternative was to drink bird saliva (eek!). But when the million-dollar question \u2014 the question of Kylie and Khlo\u00e9\\'s pregnancy rumours, obvs \u2014 inevitably came up, Kim chose to drink a sardine smoothie instead. This is one of those moments we\\'re glad we\\'re not famous.  Kiki has shut down rumours about her reaction to Kylie\\'s pregnancy, but hasn\\'t given us any clues as to whether the rumours are actually true or not. Guess we\\'ll just have to keep being patient.  As for James, he refused to reveal which of his guests was the most obnoxious (he ate a scorpion instead!), but did say that Kylie was his least favourite Kardashian. The youngest sister was supposed to appear on Corden\\'s show, but apparently backed out. ',\n 'Yes, Kim Kardashian And Kanye West Are Signing A Prenup, But Guess Who Is Worth More  The fact that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West plan to sign a prenuptial agreement probably won\\'t come as a surprise to many, but recent claims on who is worth more probably will.  TMZ reported Kardashian and West will sign a prenup to keep their assets separate and form a joint account for living expenses. While other reports have pegged West\\'s net worth about $100 million and Kardashian\\'s about $40 million, TMZ says, \"[W]e\\'re told Kim\\'s actually worth more than Kanye.\"  The \"Yeezus\" star may fancy himself a genius, but could Kardashian\\'s celebrity brand be bringing in more dough?  The exact sum of their net worths might be unclear, but Forbes offers some information on their annual earnings thus far. According to those figures, however, the singer is still ahead of the reality starlet.  Currently, West ranks at No. 59 on Forbes\\' \"Celebrity 100\" list. As of June 2013, he has made $20 million. Forbes notes that his new album and tour will certainly increase this amount.  Meanwhile, Forbes ranks Kardashian at No. 66. As of June 2013, she has made $10 million from her reality show and business ventures. However, this is much lower than what she made in 2012 from cash related to her 72-day marriage to Kris Humphries. Another (made-for-TV?) wedding could be just the thing to boost that bank account back up.  On Thursday night, Kimye made their first public appearance since their engagement. They looked blissfully happy at Spago in Beverly Hills for the Dream for Future Africa Foundation Inaugural Gala, and Kardashian wasn\\'t shy about flashing her 15-carat engagement ring for the paparazzi. ',\n 'Obama Says Leaving Malia at College Was \u2018Like Open-Heart Surgery\u2019  After Malia Obama went off to Harvard University last month, her father couldn\u2019t hold back the tears.  Barack Obama described that moment on Monday in a speech for the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children, which was named for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden\u2019s older son, who died of brain cancer in 2015.  The former president said some kind words about Beau and his parents, Joe and Jill Biden, before talking about the joys and sorrows of watching children grow up.  \u201cFor those of us who have daughters, it just happens fast,\u201d Mr. Obama said in a video published by WDEL, a news outlet based in Wilmington, Del.  \u201cI dropped off Malia at college, and I was saying to Joe and Jill that it was a little bit like open-heart surgery, and I was proud that I did not cry in front of her. But on the way back, the Secret Service was all looking straight ahead pretending they weren\u2019t hearing me as I sniffled and blew my nose. It was rough.\u201d  Malia, 19, took a gap year after high school and opted to attend Harvard this year, despite her father\u2019s advice that she could get a good education even if she did not attend \u201csome name-brand, famous, fancy school.\u201d  Both Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, attended law school at Harvard.  Mr. Obama has let the tears flow in public on a number of occasions, including when he spoke shortly after the death of his grandmother in November 2008; when he thanked his campaign staff after winning re-election in November 2012; and during a speech about gun violence in January 2016.  In his speech on Monday, Mr. Obama praised the work of the Beau Biden Foundation, which is dedicated to protecting children from abuse.  \u201cAt the end of our lives, whatever else we\u2019ve accomplished, the thing that we\u2019ll remember are the joys that our children \u2014 and hopefully, way later, our grandchildren \u2014 bring us,\u201d he said.  \u201cAnd holding their hand, swinging them on a swing, listening to them talk about what had happened in school; simple stuff, but ultimately that\u2019s what matters.\u201d  ',\n 'No, Justin Bieber didn\\'t pee his $690 pants  Next time Justin Bieber buys someone flowers, he\\'s definitely going to include a vase.  On Thursday, photos emerged of Justin Bieber walking around LA with a suspicious stain on his pants, with\\xa0the Internet speculating\\xa0that the 22-year-old singer couldn\\'t make it to the bathroom fast enough.  To make matters worse, the pants in question were grey sweats from the celebrity-adored\\xa0fashion brand Vetements, retailing at a price tag of $690. (Bieber\\'s ex Selena Gomez is also a fan of the brand\\'s sweatpants, wearing a\\xa0similar green pair last year in Tokyo.)           As Bieber followers may recall, this isn\\'t the star\\'s first brush with\\xa0public urination. In 2013, Bieber\\xa0urinated into a mop bucket while his friends filmed\\xa0the incident, which ending with him lobbing expletives at former President Bill Clinton, for which he later apologized.  This time around, Bieber quickly set the record straight on Twitter, explaining he experienced a different kind of accident.  \"Someone got me flowers and I was driving, made a turn, and the water spilled on my (expletive)\\xa0area...Didn\\'t bother me if it made ya laugh nice!\" he tweeted.  Turns out, it was just some Cold Water.  Bieber worked out his bouquet issues just in time - his 23rd birthday arrives on March 1. ',\n \"Jennifer Hudson And Kelly Clarkson Are Coming To 'The Voice'  On Wednesday, the \u201cHairspray Live\u201d star shared the news with her followers on Twitter, writing, \u201cLet\u2019s do this #TeamJHud!!\u201d Hudson will sit alongside\\xa0Miley Cyrus, Adam Levine and Blake Shelton.  \u201cIn tears thinking of what this means and represents to me and knowing and walking the journey!\u201d she wrote.  Of course, Hudson knows her way around a singing competition show, so we think it\u2019s safe to say she\u2019ll be a great fit. Not only was she a winning coach on the U.K. version of \u201cThe Voice,\u201d she also got her start appearing as a contestant on the third season of \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d (Despite coming in seventh place, she\u2019s hands down one of the most famous \u201cIdol\u201d alums.)  \u201cJennifer is an extraordinary vocal talent and one of the premier voices of our time.\\xa0She embodies the experience, expertise, positivity and sheer talent that \u2018The Voice\u2019 stands for,\u201d Paul Telegdy, NBC\u2019s president of NBC\u2019s alternative and reality group, said in a statement obtained by Variety. \u201cHer exceptional skills as a singer and actress have extended to film, television and Broadway, which makes her an incredible addition and a natural fit for our show.\u201d  Later on Thursday, it was announced that \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d OG Kelly Clarkson would also be joining the NBC show, where she\u2019ll coach with Levine and Shelton in Season 14, according to Variety. The outlet noted a fourth coach for that season has not yet been confirmed.  \u201cI\u2019m so excited to join \u2018The Voice\u2019 at NBC,\u201d Clarkson said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve been going back and forth with them for years on joining their team and the timing hasn\u2019t been right until now. Ever since NBC and I worked together on my Christmas special years ago we have established an amazing relationship and I have always loved coming on to either mentor, or perform on \u2018The Voice\u2019 over the years. I can\u2019t wait to turn my chair and see the faces of up and coming artists that I may be able to help get that push and support they\u2019ve been needing to break into this industry. Watch out Shelton\u2026 I\u2019m comin\u2019 to win!\u201d  The fact that Hudson and Clarkson are headed to \u201cThe Voice\u201d\\xa0seems like a loss for the team in charge of the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d reboot, especially since the two singers are among the competition show\u2019s biggest success stories.\\xa0Variety reports Clarkson was asked to judge on \u201cIdol,\u201d but it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s happening now. \",\n 'Gwen Stefani Will Reunite with Boyfriend Blake Shelton to Coach The Voice Season 12  The pop star will be reunited with boyfriend Blake Shelton as well as longtime coach Adam Levine for the twelfth season of the NBC singing competition, the show announced Tuesday. Rounding out the celebrity panel is current coach Alicia Keys.  Stefani, 47, and Shelton, 40, famously met on the seventh season, and it\\'s almost been a year since the pair went public with their romance during the ninth, while they were recovering from divorces from Gavin Rossdale and Miranda Lambert, respectively.  The couple also performed their duet \"Go Ahead and Break My Heart\" for the first time on season 10.  Throughout the show\\'s 10 completed seasons, team Blake has a total of four champions with team Adam following closely behind with three wins. Past coaches Christina Aguilera, Usher and Pharrell Williams all have won one season.  New coach Miley Cyrus has also signed back on, but for season 13, premiering next fall.  Season 12 of The Voice will begin in February 2017. ',\n 'Lindsay Lohan talks drugs, booze, rehab, sex  Just days before checking into court-ordered rehab last week, the actress spoke extensively to Piers Morgan in an article for London\\'s Daily Mail newspaper, which published it in this Sunday\\'s edition.  She\\'s spent more than 250 days in rehab and another trip \"is pointless,\" she said in the Daily Mail story. Instead, she should be allowed to \"go\\xa0abroad to different countries and work with children.\"  Lohan\\'s life and career ran off the rails starting in her disastrous year of 2007 when she was twice convicted of drunken driving, once for cocaine use, made three trips to rehab and served an 84-minute jail stay. Her arrests were \"totally irresponsible -- a stupid mistake,\" she said.  \"And from then on, the press were on me all the time,\" Lohan said. \"It was the first time I\\'d taken drugs. I was out in a club with people I shouldn\\'t have been with, and took cocaine, and got in the car. It was so stupid.\"  Her first rehab visit was not because of drugs or alcohol but to help her deal with the trauma she experienced making a movie, she told Morgan.  She voluntary checked into the Wonderland Center in Los Angeles while she was shooting \"I Know Who Killed Me\" in January 2007.  \"I was having really bad nightmares, and the movie was pretty traumatizing,\" Lohan said. \"So I stayed in a facility so I could get some sleep and talk about it with someone the next day, because it was overwhelming. But I would leave every day and just sleep there at night. I liked that. It was kind of like having my own live-in therapist, because I was having crazy nightmares and I was having AA meetings on set and stuff. It really helped.\"  She had been drinking for less than a year at that point, Lohan said. She stayed away from alcohol after her first hangover experience at 17, when her mother made her \"sleep with vomit still on me so I\\'d understand how it felt,\" she said. \"I was too scared!\"  She was a good teenager, she said. \"My friends and I would actually pretend to be drunk,\" she said. \"And it was more fun. I never rebelled against my parents -- I worked hard, I was responsible and I didn\\'t go to high-school parties.\"  She doesn\\'t consider herself to be an alcoholic -- \"I\\'ve never woken up in the morning and had a drink\" -- but \"when I was younger, I was definitely going out too much and I was drinking too much.\"  Lohan considers herself an expert on rehab facilities.  \"I\\'ve been court-ordered to do it six times,\" she said. \"I could write the book on rehab. Constantly sending me to rehab is pointless. The first few times I was court-ordered to rehab, it was like a joke, like killing time.\"  Morgan interviewed her before the confusion erupted over which rehab facility she would enter. After arriving at one -- which California officials said was unlicensed -- she left for the Betty Ford Clinic, where she spent her last and longest rehab stay.  \"I look at it as a good thing,\" she said about this rehab visit. \"I can come back afterwards and be fully focused on work. But I think there are other things I could do instead of going to\\xa0a rehab center that would benefit\\xa0me more. The best thing they could do for me would be to make me go\\xa0abroad to different countries and work with children.\"  If she is not a drug user -- she tells Morgan she smoked \"some pot\" a year ago -- or an alcoholic, then why would she need rehab, Morgan asked.  \"This is where it gets hard for me to explain,\" she said. \"I don\\'t think there\\'s anything wrong with people taking time to just be by themselves. I think people want to see me do that. They will keep saying the same things about me if I don\\'t. I don\\'t think it will be a bad thing for me to be away with myself for three months.\"  Although now confessing to Morgan that she used drugs a year ago, she told Matt Lauer on NBC\\'s \"Today\" show a year ago that that she was \"clean and sober\" then for \"a long time.\"  Although she was once arrested for cocaine possession and later sent to rehab when she violated probation by testing positive for the drug, Lohan said she rarely used it since \"I don\\'t like it.\"  \"It reminds me of my dad,\" she said. \"I took it four times in a period from about the age of 20 to 23, and I got caught twice.\"  Cocaine made her feel \"a little too buzzed -- it made me feel uncomfortable,\" she told Morgan.  She\\'s not \"a junkie,\" she said. \"It\\'s the truth. I\\'ve never taken heroin either, never injected myself with anything, never done LSD. Those things all scare me.\"  Her drugs of choice are \"pot, obviously, and Ecstasy,\" she said. \"I liked\\xa0that (Ecstasy) better than the others.\" Morgan reports Lohan then giggled.  Lohan has previously acknowledged having a drug problem, though. She posted this Twitter message in September 2010 just before entering the Betty Ford Clinic for three months: \"Substance abuse is a disease, which unfortunately doesn\\'t go away over night. I am working hard to overcome it and am taking positive steps.\"  Lohan claimed to Morgan that she\\'s just misunderstood. The constant online tabloid reports of late-night partying, which sometimes results in legal issues, don\\'t show the real person.  \"I\\'ve never been a junkie, and never will be,\" she said. \"I just like going out late to clubs with friends and listening to music. Always have done. It\\'s not that unusual for girls of 26!\"  She slowed down on her drinking on the advice of an actor, Lohan said.  Lohan also talked to Morgan about her sexuality -- she\\'s straight despite a past relationship with a woman. \"I like boys,\" she said.  \"I know I\\'m straight,\" she said. \"I have made out with girls before, and I had a relationship with a girl. But I think I needed to experience that and I think I was looking for something different.\"  \"I like being in a relationship with a guy,\" Lohan said. \"But there\\'s something just different about it with a woman. When I was with Samantha, I didn\\'t want to leave, because I didn\\'t want to be alone. It was very toxic.\"  About her father, Michael Lohan: \"He won\\'t change,\" she said. \"I just think there comes a point where you just kind of have to accept what it is.  \"Whenever I do try to bring him back into my life, he creates chaos for me and uses it to his advantage. He\\'s been really good and then really crazy my whole life.\"  While she blames the Los Angeles lifestyle for steering her off course, she does point to two Hollywood women who have helped her.  \"Meryl Streep was nice,\" Lohan said. \"She just advised me on my acting and what I needed to do differently, and she told me I needed to go back to live with my mum for a while.\"  She couldn\\'t move back to New York because at the time, her probation requirements, which including regular drug testing, restricted her to California -- \"the worst possible place I could be,\" she said.  \"Jamie Lee Curtis was very kind to me, too,\" she said. \"She also told me to listen to good advice and to get rid of the hangers-on.\"  Will you see another story about Lindsay Lohan\\'s substance abuse and legal troubles before she\\'s scheduled to get out of rehab in early August? What could happen in the Betty Ford Clinic, a well-respected refuge for those needing to get their lives back on track?  Lohan was accused of assaulting a Ford staff member during her last stay in December 2010, although the investigation was suspended on December 24 after the staffer drops charges against Lohan.  Just weeks after her release from there, she was again involved in controversy for stealing a necklace from a jewelry store. It was that shoplifting conviction that put her on the road to her current rehab visit. ',\n 'Kanye West is launching his own makeup line called Donda  Rapper-come-designer Kanye West has already conquered the music industry and taken on fashion with his Yeezy line, but now it seems that West is taking cues from his 19-year-old sister-in-law Kylie Jenner and branching out with a beauty brand.  Officially re-entering the public eye following a much-needed break from the spotlight, TMZ report that West has officially filed legal documents \"declaring his intention\" to launch a full collection of Donda cosmetics.  The line, which is thought to involve everything from makeup and perfume to lotions, will be an extension of the far-reaching communications company he named after his late mother, Donda, who passed away in 2007.  Not limited to beauty though, West has previously tweeted an infographic explaining the \"categories of influence\" that Donda as a brand might take on, including amusement parks, furnishings, fitness, medical research, hovercrafts and steamboats.  Perhaps a make-up range isn\\'t so farfetched after all.  As someone that has shown little-to-no interest in beauty IRL, it\\'s hard to visualise what a line of Kanye cosmetics would look like, but while mainstream cosmetics for men is still in its infancy, this does come after the likes of Maybelline and L\\'Oreal announced their first ever male spokesmodels.  While little else is known at this stage, following his attempts to be taken seriously as a fashion designer beauty seems a natural next step.  The application to trademark the concept is currently processing and it looks like Yeezy-designed cosmetics really are going to be a thing.

Ms. Kelly\u2019s first week was highly scrutinized, and the early reviews for the show were brutal. She addressed them at the end of her hour on Sept. 29, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s been very exciting, it\u2019s been so educational, I\u2019ve been just so delighted by the media response, which is really\u201d \u2014 she shook her head before continuing \u2014 \u201cno.\u201d  After a breath, she added, \u201cThe viewer response has been awesome!\u201d  As Ms. Kelly moved away from the sometimes prosecutorial persona she inhabited during much of her tenure at Fox, there were a few bumpy moments. The \u201cWill & Grace\u201d star Debra Messing said after appearing on the show that she regretted having done so. Jane Fonda blanched when Ms. Kelly asked her to talk about plastic surgery procedures she has had. And a vulgarity uttered by a cameraman who inadvertently walked into a shot went viral.  Another awkward moment came on Oct. 3, two days after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, when Ms. Kelly cut off Tom Brokaw, the former longtime NBC anchor and network eminence, as he went into a lengthy discourse on gun rights and the National Rifle Association.  \u201cGot it,\u201d Ms. Kelly said, adding that she had to \u201cleave it at that, Tom,\u201d before shifting to a commercial break. (Mr. Brokaw later told The Washington Post that he was having problems with his hearing aid. \u201cI\u2019m a Kelly fan,\u201d he added.)  Ms. Kelly has said that the show would be a mix of a talk show and a news show, and it has moved in both directions, from typical morning fare \u2014 celebrity interviews, a segment involving an adorable crime-fighting dog \u2014 to gritty discussions of the O. J. Simpson and Menendez brothers cases.  NBC has said from the start that it would be patient with the show. Andrew Lack, the network\u2019s news chairman, told affiliates months ago that he did not expect things to be \u201cperfect\u201d with both of Ms. Kelly\u2019s new programs \u2014 she also hosts a Sunday evening show, which is on hiatus \u2014 in the early going.  At least for now, it appears that Ms. Kelly\u2019s main competitor, ABC\u2019s \u201cLive with Kelly and Ryan,\u201d will maintain a lead in the ratings. In the top 56 media markets, \u201cLive\u201d beat \u201cMegyn Kelly Today\u201d by 21 percent in households last week, according to Nielsen.  Exact audience figures for last week\u2019s episodes of \u201cLive,\u201d a syndicated show featuring Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest, will not be available until next week. It averaged an 2.8 million viewers in the week before Ms. Kelly\u2019s debut, with 915,000 in the 25-to-54 age range.  For Ms. Kelly and NBC executives, there was one hopeful nugget buried in the Nielsen data: The number of viewers in the 25-to-54 demographic was 755,000 on Sept. 29, after having fallen to roughly 649,000 the day before.

InTouch magazine earlier on Wednesday quoted an unnamed friend of the couple as stating Aniston was pregnant.  \"She and Justin are ecstatic. Jen has wanted to have a baby with Justin for years,\" the magazine claimed the friend said.  \"Their baby news came at a bad time in her life, too - she just lost her mother, and she and Justin almost broke up. But now this surprise pregnancy has turned the worst of times into the best of times.\"  Aniston\\'s mother, Nancy Dow, died on May 25. She had suffered strokes in 2011 and 2012.  The magazine published pictures that it claimed showed Aniston had a \"baby bump\".

And yet, the 52-year-old actor can\\'t even begin to fathom the idea of the real estate mogul running the United States.  While discussing the British\\xa0exit from the European Union, Pitt opened up to the New York Times\\'\\xa0T\\xa0magazine about his feelings toward Trump.  \"Man, I never thought [Brexit]\\xa0would happen. Same way I can\\'t bring myself to think that Trump will be in charge,\" he admitted. \"In the simplest terms, what brings us together is good, and what separates us is bad.\"  He continued, \"We have this great line in The Big Short,\" referring to last year\\'s\\xa0Oscar-winning film about the global financial crisis of 2008, which he produced. \"When things are going wrong and we can\\'t find the reason for it, we just start creating enemies.\" ',\n 'Taylor Swift Cries During Selena Gomez\\'s Heartbreaking AMA Performance, Gets Some Serious Side Eye   Taylor Swift was moved to tears by Selena Gomez\\'s debut performance of \"The Heart Wants What It Wants\" at the 2014 American Music Awards.  The country pop star was clearly feeling her BFF\\'s pain, but that didn\\'t stop a few fellow audience members from shooting her some serious side eye. But, hey, T.Swift sang it herself-haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.  The \"Shake It Off\" singer went through a lot of emotions during Sunday night\\'s show. When she wasn\\'t crying with Selena, she was dancing with Justin Bieber\\'s on-off love in the audience-and Lorde, too! She also performed her don\\'t-cross-me single \"Blank Space\" for the first time on live TV. She played up her boy crazy, man-eating persona during the fiery (literally!) performance, but she showed her true colors when it came time to accept The Dick Clark Award for Excellence, presented to her by Diana Ross.  \"I am blown away to have received an award from Diana Ross, who over the course of her career just stood up for herself so many times in a time when it was not popular for a woman to stand up for herself,\" she said. \"I am so honored. Thank you for coming. You\\'re beautiful.\"  \"Dick Clark-Dick Clark was a visionary,\" she said. \"He fought for music to be at the forefront of our minds and on our televisions as much as possible. I\\'m so unbelievably ecstatic that his family chose to honor me and that the AMAs chose to honor me with this.\"  She even took the opportunity to speak out on her anti-streaming stance (sorry, Spotify), saying, \"And lastly, you, you guys! To the fans who went out and bought over a million copies of my last three albums, what you did by going out and investing in music and albums, you are saying that you believe in the same thing that I believe in-that music is valuable, and that music should be consumed in albums, and that albums should be consumed as art and appreciated, and I love you so much.\"  \"I love getting to know you,\" she said, addressing her fans. \"I love talking to you online. I love having a glimpse into your life and I\\'m so unbelievably happy that you want to have a glimpse into my life. Thank you so much.\"  Class act!  ',\n 'Nicole Kidman Finally Admits To Botox  As far as we can tell, Botox tops the list of celebrity guilty pleasures: Everybody does it, but nobody talks about it. Except Nicole Kidman, that is.  The actress\\' seldom-moving face has been the subject of speculation the past few years, inspiring headlines like \"Help! I Can\\'t Move My Face!\" Fortunately, Nicole\\'s decided to address the rumors head on. And even though we\\'ve seen a bit of flip-flopping, her latest stance is that her visage is \"completely natural.\"  \"No surgery for me,\" Nicole tells Italy\\'s La Repubblica. \"I did try Botox, unfortunately, but I got out of it and now I can finally move my face again.\"  We don\\'t know how recently this skin epiphany went into effect, but it\\'s safe to say that her face stayed suspiciously still at the Golden Globes this month -- nary a frown line or a crow\\'s foot. Also, back in May 2011, the 45-year-old maintained that she had \"nothing\" in her face, so was she glossing over the whole Botox thing?  This time around, she deemed the non-surgical treatment an \"unfortunate move\" and that she\\'s moved on to more effective age-defying tricks. \"I wear sunscreen, I don\\'t smoke and I take care of myself, and I am proud to say that,\" Nicole said.  Sunscreen as the fountain of youth? Well played, Nicole.   ',\n 'Late-Night Hosts React to O.J. Simpson Parole News O.J. Simpson was granted parole Thursday, after serving almost nine years in prison for armed robbery and assault with a weapon, and late-night TV had a lot to say about it.  On ABC, Jimmy Kimmel mocked the local reporters who repeatedly announced throughout Thursday that \"the Juice is loose,\" before explaining who Simpson was to his younger viewers.  \"O.J. Simpson \u2014 for those of you too young to remember, is the second-most embarrassing person associated with the Kardashian family, right after Scott Disick,\" said Kimmel.  \"Technically, the Juice is not on the loose yet \u2014 he could be released by Oct.\\xa01 \u2014 on which date, he will be picked up at the Lovelock Correctional Facility via helicopter and flown directly to the set of Dancing With The Stars, or Bachelor in Paradise. Whichever show is currently in production.\"  On Comedy Central\\'s Daily Show, Trevor Noah teased Simpson for saying he has mostly led a \"conflict-free life.\" Impersonating the former football player Noah said, \"Yeah, I had a lot of conflict, and I mostly got off free.\"  Noah continued: \"O.J. and his people reminded us that he\u2019s been a model citizen in prison. He petitioned for books for the library; he coached a softball team; he never got in trouble. To me, that\u2019s kind of a reason to keep him in prison \u2014 it\u2019s the only place he\u2019s not committing crimes.\u201d  \"O.J. got away baby,\" said Stephen Colbert in his monologue on CBS\\' Late Show. \"Finally, he has the opportunity to find the real killer. Step one: buy a mirror. It\\'ll help.\"  Colbert also showed a photo of Simpson and Donald Trump from 1993 and joked the photo was taken \"when it was still a coin toss which one of those guys would be president and which one would end up in jail.\"  On NBC\\'s Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon told his audience to be careful calling an Uber now, to make sure it\\'s not a white Ford Bronco.  \u201cO.J. actually\\xa0video-conferenced\\xa0into his parole hearing today, because the board was 120 miles away from his prison. Yeah, not a good sign when even the parole board is scared to be near him,\" he said.  \"A lot of people didn\u2019t know how to feel about the news. On one hand, O.J. is a convicted felon. But, on the other hand, he managed to keep Trump off TV for a whole afternoon,\" said Fallon, joking that it\\'s kind of like community service.  The former football, film and TV star could be released\\xa0as soon as Oct. 1, at which point he will have served the minimum of his nine- to 33-year sentence.  Commissioners who heard his case voted unanimously to grant the 70-year-old parole.\\xa0The 2008 conviction \u2014 which stemmed from a failed attempt to steal sports memorabilia and other items he claimed had been stolen from him \u2014 came 13 years after his 1995 acquittal in the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.  The 1995 murder trial was a national sensation at the time, with interest\\xa0reignited\\xa0last year with the debut of FX\\'s award-winning miniseries\\xa0The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story.  When asked if he would be able to stay out of trouble, Simpson explained that he had taken an alternatives to violence course, and also said, \"I had basically spent a conflict-free life,\" which got an immediate reaction on social media given the sensational murder trial and years of abuse allegations from his ex-wife.  In his closing remarks, he apologized again.  \"I\\'m sorry it happened, I\\'m sorry, Nevada,\" he said. \"I thought I was glad to get my stuff back, but it just wasn\\'t worth it. It wasn\\'t worth it and I\\'m sorry.`\" ',\n 'Jennifer Aniston wants to set up a wellness centre  Jennifer Aniston wants to open a wellness centre in the future.

The couple famously met on set of Mr & Mrs Smith in 2004 while\\xa0Brad was already married to Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and they sparked a media frenzy when Brad left Jen and pursued a relationship with Ange a short while later.  It might sound like an EastEnders-worthy love triangle, but it was all very real for Jen, and Brangelina happened for a good thirteen\\xa0years before it suddenly broke down at the end of last year.  But anyone gunning for a friendly reunion between Brad and Jen (is Bren a thing?) after all these years may finally get their wish, as it has been reported that the two are 'texting' amidst Brad's divorce from Angelina.  According to US Weekly, Brad reached out to Jen to wish her a happy 48th birthday in February and the former couple started making baby steps to rebuilding their broken relationship.  A source told the publication: 'They started talking once he wished her a happy birthday.  'Brad's told her he's having a hard time with his split and they exchanged a few\\xa0texts reminiscing about the past.'  However, anyone hoping that Bren is going to happen again will be sorely disappointed.

This morning, after a social media blackout followed closely by cryptic clips of a coiling, striking snake, Swift pulled back the curtain on her forthcoming album, Reputation \u2014which expects a November 10 release, according to a subsequent frame\u2014with a stark black and white beauty shot featuring a new take on her trademark beauty look.  Gone are the bangs, the polished bob , and the fringed shag . In their place, the singer debuts a dampened mane of soft, finger-raked waves, with a hint of James Dean volume at the crown. The homage makes sense: the singer's portrait strikes a rebellious note, from her posturing to the silver chain choker around her neck. And though makeup is still present, Swift's painted matte lip looks more femme fatale than ladylike, coupled with bare skin and long eyelashes. Considering the album's telling title, and the clever repurposing of social media's favorite snake emoji, it seems Swift is taking her image into her own hands. So far, devil-may-care looks good on the pop star.  \",\n 'Trump recorded having extremely lewd conversation about women in 2005   Donald Trump bragged in vulgar terms about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women during a 2005 conversation caught on a hot microphone, saying that \"when you\\'re a star, they let you do it,\" according to a video obtained by The Washington Post.  The video captures Trump talking with Billy Bush, then of \"Access Hollywood,\" on a bus with the show\\'s name written across the side. They were arriving on the set of \"Days of Our Lives\" to tape a segment about Trump\\'s cameo on the soap opera.  Late Friday night, following sharp criticism by Republican leaders, Trump issued a short video statement saying, \"I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize.\" But he also called the revelation \"a distraction from the issues we are facing today.\" He said that his \"foolish\" words are much different than the words and actions of Bill Clinton, whom he accused of abusing women, and Hillary Clinton, whom he accused of having \"bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.\"  \"I\\'ve never said I\\'m a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I\\'m not. I\\'ve said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me knows these words don\\'t reflect who I am,\" Trump said.  In an apparent response to Republican critics asking him to drop out of the race, he said: \"We will discuss this more in the coming days. See you at the debate on Sunday.\"  The tape includes audio of Bush and Trump talking inside the bus, as well as audio and video once they emerge from it to begin shooting the segment.  In that audio, Trump discusses a failed attempt to seduce a woman, whose full name is not given in the video.  \"I moved on her, and I failed. I\\'ll admit it,\" Trump is heard saying. It was unclear when the events he was describing took place. The tape was recorded several months after he married his third wife, Melania.  \"I did try and f--- her. She was married,\" Trump says.  Trump continues: \"And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, \\'I\\'ll show you where they have some nice furniture.\\'\"  \"I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn\\'t get there. And she was married,\" Trump says. \"Then all of a sudden I see her, she\\'s now got the big phony tits and everything. She\\'s totally changed her look.\"  At that point in the audio, Trump and Bush appear to notice Arianne Zucker, the actress who is waiting to escort them into the soap-opera set.  \"Your girl\\'s hot as s---, in the purple,\" says Bush, who\\'s now a co-host of NBC\\'s \"Today\" show.  \"I\\'ve got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her,\" Trump says. \"You know I\\'m automatically attracted to beautiful - I just start kissing them. It\\'s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don\\'t even wait.\"  \"And when you\\'re a star, they let you do it,\" Trump says. \"You can do anything.\"  \"Whatever you want,\" says another voice, apparently Bush\\'s.  \"Grab them by the p---y,\" Trump says. \"You can do anything.\"  [In wake of debate, multiple women accuse Trump of sexual advances]  A spokeswoman for NBC Universal, which produces and distributes \"Access Hollywood,\" declined to comment.  \"This was locker-room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course - not even close,\" Trump said in a statement. \"I apologize if anyone was offended.\"  Billy Bush, in a statement released by NBC Universal, said: \"Obviously I\\'m embarrassed and ashamed. It\\'s no excuse, but this happened eleven years ago - I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I\\'m very sorry.\"  After the video appeared online Friday afternoon, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton wrote on Twitter: \"This is horrific. We cannot allow this man to become president.\" Her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.), told reporters, \"It makes me sick to my stomach,\" while campaigning in Las Vegas.  Planned Parenthood Action Fund, which has endorsed Clinton, issued a statement from Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens saying: \"What Trump described in these tapes amounts to sexual assault.\"  Trump was also criticized by members of his own party. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who said he is \"sickened\" by Trump\\'s comments, said the Republican presidential candidate will no longer appear with him at a campaign event in Wisconsin on Saturday.  \"Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified. I hope Mr. Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests,\" Ryan said in a statement.  In a short statement issued moments after Ryan\\'s, Trump said his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, \"will be representing me\" at the Wisconsin event.  Sen. Kelly Ayotte (N.H.), who is running for reelection and has said she will vote for Trump, called his comments \"totally inappropriate and offensive.\"  Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has stood by Trump uncritically through numerous controversies, said in a statement: \"No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.\"  Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, a Trump critic, said in a statement: \"Hitting on married women? Condoning assault? Such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America\\'s face to the world.\"  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the comments are \"repugnant, and unacceptable in any circumstance\" and made clear Trump\\'s brief statement would not suffice.  \"As the father of three daughters, I strongly believe that Trump needs to apologize directly to women and girls everywhere, and take full responsibility for the utter lack of respect for women shown in his comments on that tape,\" he said late Friday.  One of Trump\\'s most prominent social-conservative supporters, Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, told BuzzFeed\\'s Rosie Gray: \"My personal support for Donald Trump has never been based upon shared values.\"  Trump\\'s running mate, Pence, was at a diner in Toledo when the news broke - about to view the diner\\'s collection of signed cardboard hot-dog buns, which includes one signed by Trump. But the reporters traveling with Pence were quickly ushered out of the diner by campaign staff, before they could ask Trump\\'s running mate about it, according to Politico. Politico reported that the journalists, traveling in Pence\\'s \"protective pool,\" were not permitted to film Pence as he left the diner.  The tape appears at a time when Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has sought to make a campaign issue out of his opponent\\'s marriage. Trump has criticized former president Bill Clinton for his past infidelity and criticized opponent Hillary Clinton as her husband\\'s \"enabler.\"  \"Hillary Clinton was married to the single greatest abuser of women in the history of politics,\" Trump told the New York Times in a recent interview. \"Hillary was an enabler, and she attacked the women who Bill Clinton mistreated afterward. I think it\\'s a serious problem for them, and it\\'s something that I\\'m considering talking about more in the near future.\"  Trump carried on a very public affair with Marla Maples - his eventual second wife - while still married to first wife Ivana Trump.  Trump has been criticized in this campaign for derogatory and lewd comments about women, including some made on TV and live radio. In an interview Wednesday with KSNV, a Las Vegas television station, Trump said that those comments were made for entertainment.  \"A lot of that was done for the purpose of entertainment. There\\'s nobody that has more respect for women than I do,\" he told the station.  \"Are you trying to tone it down now?\" asked the interviewer, Jim Snyder.  \"It\\'s not a question of trying, it\\'s very easy,\" Trump said.  The tape obtained by The Post seems to have captured Trump in a private moment, with no audience beyond Bush and a few others on the bus. It appears to have been shot around Sept.\\xa016, 2005, which was the day media reports said Trump would tape his soap-opera cameo.  The video shows the bus carrying Trump and Bush turning down a street on the studio back lot. The two men cannot be seen.  \"Oof, get out of the way, honey,\" Bush says, apparently referencing somebody else blocking the view of Zucker.  The two men then exit the bus and greet Zucker.  \"We\\'re ready, let\\'s go,\" Trump says, after the initial greetings. \"Make me a soap star.\"  \"How about a little hug for the Donald?\" Bush says. \"He just got off the bus.\"  \"Would you like a little hug, darling?\" Zucker says.  \"Absolutely,\" Trump says. As they embrace, and air-kiss, Trump says, \"Melania said this was okay.\"  The video then follows Trump, Bush and Zucker into the studio. Trump did appear on \"Days of Our Lives\" in late October. In a tape of that cameo posted online, Zucker\\'s character asks Trump - playing himself - for a job at his business, and tells him suggestively, \"I think you\\'ll find I\\'m a very willing employee. Working under you, I think, could be mutually beneficial.\"  Trump\\'s character gives her the brushoff.  \"That\\'s an interesting proposition,\" Trump says on-screen. \"I\\'ll get back to you.\"  A publicist for Zucker did not immediately respond to questions on Friday afternoon.  Rosalind S. Helderman, Mike DeBonis, Jenna Johnson and Sarah Parnass contributed to this report.

We get to decide for ourselves what is beautiful when it comes to our bodies. That decision is ours and ours alone,\" she wrote. \"Let\\'s make that decision for ourselves and for the young women in this world who look to us as examples.

The rapper, who was filmed delivering onstage rants during recent shows in California, on Monday\\xa0canceled the remaining 21 dates in his Saint Pablo tour. Hours later, he was reportedly hospitalized for stress and exhaustion.  West spent the night at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for his own safety,\\xa0the Associated Press reported. Police, without confirming the patient as West, told AP that the\\xa0officers arrived at a West Hollywood home for a disturbance, and an ambulance took the patient to the hospital to be placed on a psychiatric hold.  Before his hospitalization, West\\'s public breakdowns and stream-of-consciousness speeches have been the subject of jokes and disdain. But recent reports about West\\'s well-being have reopened a conversation about mental health, fame and hip-hop.  The genre\\xa0has long been characterized by notions of hyper-masculinity that allow little room for vulnerability, and of black and brown men putting forward a tough, adversarial persona. But hip-hop\\xa0has always had introspective moments (Geto Boys rapped \"My mind is playing tricks on me\" in 1991). In recent years, we\\'ve seen more artists opening\\xa0up about their emotional and mental struggles in the public eye and on\\xa0albums.  Eminem followed his 2009 album \"Relapse\" with one called\\xa0\"Recovery,\" after experiencing addiction and depression. DMX has rapped and spoken about suffering from bipolar disorder. In October, Kid Cudi publicly announced on his Facebook page that he checked himself into rehabilitation for his \"depression and suicidal urges,\" writing \"anxiety and depression have ruled my life for as long as I can remember and I never leave the house because of it.\"  This followed angry tweets directed at Drake and West.  After it became public knowledge that Kid Cudi had checked into rehab, Drake released a song with lyrics dissing the rapper and his mental well-being. And despite the backlash against Drake online, the Toronto rapper doubled\\xa0down.  But much of the response to Kid Cudi was positive. A hashtag, #YouGoodMan, gained momentum as a conversation around masculinity, race and mental health took place on social media.  On Monday, Kid Cudi posted a list of celebrities, artists and fans who actively supported him (including\\xa0West). \"Thank you for opening your hearts and extending your love and support during a troubling time,\" he wrote.  Kendrick Lamar has also written and spoken about depression and the emotional tumult of being on a world tour while his best friends back home were gunned down. Much of his album \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" centers on survivor\\'s guilt.  [The sound and the fury of Kendrick Lamar at the Kennedy Center]  His lyrics were used for a Kaiser Permanente ad about depression. After a 2015 concert, Lamar saw a woman crying and murmuring \"You saved my life.\" She told him she was going to kill herself a year ago, but his music helped her through.  Pharoahe Monch, a beloved independent artist, has been open about dealing with depression, which he has said in interviews was induced by a combination of medications he was taking\\xa0following\\xa0hospitalization for his asthma.  \"At that time, it wasn\\'t really like it was now, where you have people talking about issues readily in the public,\" he said in a 2014 interview. \"Years ago, it was just, \\'Yo, you bugging. Just deal with it.\\'\"  In another interview, he told MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry that it was important for his 2014 album, \"PTSD,\" to include frank and vulnerable lyrics about his struggles and\\xa0the stigma of depression within the black community.  \"Growing up in the community, you look at mental issues as, we\\'re strong, and my parents were hard-working - it\\'s something that\\'s looked at as a weakness so you kind of push through it sometimes without even realizing what the issue might be.\"  In \"Losing My Mind,\" Pharoahe Monch raps, \"My family customs were not accustomed to dealing with mental health/It was more or less an issue for white families with wealth.\"  He continues: \"Void, I defected, employed self annoyed/Went independent, enjoyed stealth/Now doctors prescribed sedatives and Prozac.\"  West\\'s\\xa0lyrics, particularly on \"Life of Pablo,\" have caused alarm among some who speculate there\\'s more to them than bombastic exaggeration. For instance, on \"FML,\" he raps about nothing being crazier than when \"he off his Lexapro.\"  But West is not just a hip-hop artist; he is a megastar. Aside from music, he works\\xa0in the fashion industry, and is married to one of the most famous women in the world, one who has built her career off documenting every aspect of her life. West\\'s tweets generate trending hashtags and breathless media coverage.  [What Kanye West said at the VMAs, annotated (full transcript)]  His\\xa0public behavior over the years has fueled rumors among the public and\\xa0garnered\\xa0genuine concern from fans and those close to him. Much of this began after his mother\\'s 2007 death. He has gone on Twitter rants, given rambling interviews and stormed award-show stages - most famously in 2009, when he interrupted Taylor Swift\\'s MTV Video Music Award acceptance speech, turning him into a pariah and punchline.  Rhymefest, who has co-written West tracks for years, announced in February that he had stopped collaborating with the Chicago artist a month earlier after his work on \"Life of Pablo\" was complete. \"His mind and spirit isn\\'t right,\" Rhymefest\\xa0tweeted. He also tweeted, \"I love my brother. I pray for his health not our entertainment.\"  Last week, West brought a Sacramento concert to a halt with an onstage speech that went after, among other things,\\xa0Jay Z, Beyonc\u00e9, Hillary Clinton, MTV and Facebook.\\xa0When the news of his hospitalization broke Monday night, celebrities and artists immediately\\xa0offered words of support.  \"I want to extend a very special prayer to my big brother, Kanye West,\" Chance the Rapper, a West collaborator, said in the middle of a performance on BBC Radio 1. \"I want to just extend this prayer and extend this love from all the way in Britain. We might come back early to come see this man.\"  Producer 9th Wonder tweeted, \"been knowing the brother upwards of 13 years. Mental health is a serious thing, no matter what.\" ',\n 'Tyga Reveals Details About Kylie Jenner Breakup  In a new interview with Big Boy TV, Tyga-a month out from his split with Kylie Jenner-revealed new information about what led to the couple\\'s demise.  Tyga, 26, said his very public relationship with Jenner, 18, took the spotlight off his own career. The couple broke up in mid-May.  \"When you\\'re in a very public relationship like that, it\\'s hard for other people to see you differently than that,\" he said. \"Being in that ... it took a lot, career wise, everything. It overshadowed a lot of my talents and a lot of things that I worked hard for.\"  Tyga said he and Jenner are still friends, and that they might reunite in the future. He suggested that Jenner\\'s young age combined with her image had something to do with the breakup.  \"She\\'s young,\" he said. \"When you\\'re young, you\\'re going to make mistakes. All of those mistakes are going to be in the public eye so that puts a lot of strain on the relationship. Right now, I want to focus on what I need to do. I just wanted to get back to just me. I think for her as well.\"  According to Tyga, the breakup was mutual, as the pair agreed that they needed time apart.  \"It got to the point where it was like, \\'I respect you, you respect me.\\' I think it\\'s a mutual thing. This is what needs to happen,\" Tyga added. \"When something is so damaged or something is just not right, you can\\'t fix it in a moment. The only thing is time.\" ',\n \"Kim Kardashian's Sweet Message About Serena Williams' 'Prince': 'He Makes Her So Happy'  From the beginning, Kim Kardashian West knew Serena Williams had found her prince in Alexis Ohanian.  The\\xa0Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 37, told Vogue\\xa0that the couple were meant to be during cocktails after their wedding ceremony Thursday in New Orleans.  \u201cI\u2019ve known Serena for so long and am so happy she\u2019s found her prince,\u201d Kardashian West told the magazine. \u201cFrom the moment she told me she met Alexis in Rome, it was like\u2026 she\u2019s been so happy and has this light about her that is so special to see.\u201d  The reality star continued, \u201cYou just know it is so real. He makes her so happy and that just makes her friends happy.\u201d  The tennis champion and the Reddit co-founder married at the Contemporary Arts Center on Nov. 16, which was also the birthday of Ohanian\u2019s late mother Anke who died nine years ago.  The ceremony came just 11 weeks after the couple welcomed their baby girl,\\xa0Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., on Sept. 1\\xa0\u2014 almost two years after they began dating in 2015.  A slew of celebrity guests were in attendance, including\\xa0Beyonc\u00e9,\\xa0Kim Kardashian,\\xa0Eva Longoria\\xa0and\\xa0husband Jos\u00e9 Bast\u00f3n, and fellow tennis star\\xa0Caroline Wozniacki with her new fianc\u00e9, NBA player David Lee.  Guests dined on an around-the-world-themed dinner as the band played several of Serena\u2019s favorite Disney songs, including \u201cBe Our Guest.\u201d The bride wanted a\\xa0French ball\u2013themed reception inspired by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve\u2019s fairy tale, Beauty and the Beast, according to Vogue. Serena\u2019s sister, Venus Williams, looked gorgeous in her custom Galia Lahav bridesmaid dress as she walked down the aisle. The couple also wrote their own vows, with Ohanian telling his wife, \u201cI will always have bad jokes that make your eyes roll; make you give me the side eye. You are the greatest of all time, not just in sport. I\u2019m talking about as a mother, and as a wife. I am so excited to write so many more chapters of our fairy tale together.\u201d Their love story has been a real fairytale. In December, Williams announced their engagement on Reddit, describing the horse drawn carriage that awaited her.\u201dI came home. A little late. Someone had a bag packed for me. And a carriage waited. Destination: Rome,\u201d Williams\\xa0wrote\\xa0under her personal account. \u201cTo escort me to my very own \u2018charming.\u2019 Back to where our stars first collided.

Swift\\'s uneasy relationship with streaming services is well noted. In 2014, she pulled her music from Spotify, arguing that \"the value of an album is, and will continue to be, based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work, and the financial value that artists (and their labels) place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace\". She later allowed Apple Music to exclusively stream her \\'1989\\' album after they changed their royalty policy following a critical open letter she posted.  TMZ\\xa0recently reported that Swift filed documents to trademark a \\'Swifties\\', what they described as a streaming service \"featuring non-downloadable multi-media content in the nature of audio recordings\".  However, a source from Swift\\'s camp has since told\\xa0Billboard\\xa0that the singer \"would not be launching a streaming service\". Instead, the report suggests that Swifties would be more \"like a personalized fan club app complete with exclusive merchandise, audio/video/live performances and the possibility of a mobile game of some sort\".  Meanwhile, Ed Sheeran appears to have let slip the release date of Taylor Swift\\'s new album. There had previously been rumours that Swift would release a new album in October 2016. However, no album surfaced last autumn. The singer-songwriter had previously released each of her five albums every two years in either October or November, with her last record \\'1989\\' released in October 2014.  It was also reported last\\xa0year that Taylor Swift had recruited Drake to help her make an album of \"edgier R&B and hip-hop sounds\". \\xa0Swift is also rumoured to be\\xa0working on new music with Kesha.

So many artists were supported by her and definitely with everything she went through, she was so focused on keeping her children safe, protected and loved and really fulfilling their own dreams and she had such an elegance.\"  Katie Holmes Talks Directorial Debut, Playing Joey on \\'Dawson\\'s Creek\\' Katie Holmes speaks out about giving daughter Suri a \\'stable\\' childhood Holmes said she was struck by a Cartier-brand watch that the fashion icon often wore during her time in the White House.  \"Well she had such impeccable taste,\" Holmes said. \"She had a beautiful Cartier watch, she had beautiful jewelry and we found an antique Cartier watch just for our wardrobe cause I thought that\\'s very important because we\\'re going to see that quite often, so I fought for that. I fought for that Cartier.\"  Holmes directed one of the episodes of the series, just months after making her directorial debut with the film, \"All We Had.\"  \"I really enjoy it and being a part of directing this mini series was really exciting,\" she said. \"It was very different from the movie I directed...I really enjoy working with the actors and getting different shades of a performance out of people.\"  \"The Kennedys: After Camelot\" premieres Sunday night on Reelz.  ',\n 'Robert Pattinson: \u2018Good Time\u2019 \u2018Helped Me Become a Better Actor\u2019  Robert Pattinson is earning rave reviews for his intense and electrifying performance in A24\u2019s crime thriller, \u201cGood Time.\u201d Under the helm of directors and brothers Josh and Benny Safdie, the \u201cTwilight\u201d star hides his dashing good looks to portray a grimy, bleached blond, goatee-sporting, crook from Queens, New York, who embarks on a mission to bail his mentally impaired brother (played by co-director Benny) out of prison after a failed robbery attempt. While taking on the demanding role, Pattinson said the experience has helped him mature into a commanding actor.  \u201cI think I\u2019m more confident now; this was a challenging role and I learned a lot about my abilities as an actor,\u201d Pattinson told Variety at the film\u2019s New York premiere on Tuesday evening, held at the School of Visual Arts Theatre. \u201cEvery single time I get to do another movie, I get a little more confident. You always want to grow in some way and challenge yourself. I feel like this one has helped me become a better actor.\u201d  Critics have no doubt that Pattinson has developed into a masterful dramatic actor. He and the \u201cGood Time\u201d creators received a rousing six-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival last May where the movie first screened for an audience. The picture \u2014 out in theaters on Friday \u2014 currently holds a 94% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  Robert Pattinson on Shedding His Movie Star Looks for Cannes Drama \u2018Good Time\u2019  \u201cThe writing in this \u2014 the dialogue felt so real and different,\u201d explained the 31-year-old British star on the red carpet. \u201cIt\u2019s set in New York and I\u2019ve been here in New York a million times, but it just felt alien to me. There was something different and original about the characters and the story. I immediately knew the world of the performance that I wanted to do and I knew the energy I wanted when I saw Josh and Benny\u2019s work. This was special.\u201d  Now that Pattinson has received acclaim for his work in indie films and broken any preconceptions about his acting abilities, would he consider taking on another role in a tentpole franchise series like \u201cTwilight\u201d or stick to art house films?  \u201cI look across the board every day,\u201d he said emphatically. \u201cThe only thing I do is read script after script waiting for something to hit me. I like stories that feel authentic and it\u2019s just difficult to find. There are a lot of scripts that feel like the writer read a newspaper article and then tried to use their knowledge from film schools to adapt it. That doesn\u2019t interest me. Once I find something and feel really obsessed with it, I feel like I can really connect with the character and bring them to life.\u201d  After the screening, Pattinson joined the film\u2019s directors, producers, co-star Barkhad Abdi (\u201cCaptain Phillips\u201d), and composer Daniel Lopatin at the Flash Factory nightclub for the after-party. Guests enjoyed celebratory drinks and White Castle burgers, which are featured in the film.

In February, he visited the Smoothie King Center to watch the 2017 NBA Allstar Game with his wife, Beyonc\u00e9, and the couple\u2019s oldest daughter, Blue Ivy.

Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt bought it in 2008 for \u20ac45 million (about $67 million at the time), and it hosted\\xa0their wedding six years later.  After three years of legal battle, the decision was originally delivered in April but wasn\\'t revealed until French media broke the story last week. Meanwhile, the aggrieved designer, Odile Soudant, has filed another suit demanding to be\\xa0legally recognized as the creator of the project.  The artist, who specializes in light installations, accused the Jolie-Pitt company of driving her\\xa0business, Lumi\u00e8res Studio, into bankruptcy. She\\'s also fighting Pitt for the intellectual property rights to\\xa0the lighting she designed for the 17th century chateau and its outbuildings. Of the payout,\\xa0\u20ac60,000 ($70,800) covers\\xa0damage to her reputation, which she says has been severely affected by\\xa0the failed project.  Pitt\\'s lawyers had argued that the project was late and over budget\u2014and that the design was Pitt\\'s brainchild.  \u201cWhen, in 2010, Brad Pitt came to ask her to bring to light four buildings of his domain at\\xa0Miraval, the plastic artist Odile Soudant did not suspect that this Pharaonic building site was going to cause her ruin,\u201d writes Le Point.  The Hollywood couple, according to the newspaper Liberation, which broke the story, launched a large remodeling plan intended to\\xa0transform the property to their liking. Pitt hired Soudart in 2010 to run\\xa0a \u20ac25 million project that would\\xa0bring natural light into four of the buildings of the 40-bedroom domain where, in the late 1970s, the band Pink Floyd had recorded an album.  According to the newspaper, he wanted\\xa0the visual artist to create \"an exceptional place with light at the center of everything.\"  The collaboration went smoothly for three years until Pitt discovered that the company acting as the general contractor managing the network\\xa0of businesses involved in the remodeling was inflating the costs. He then blocked all additional payments.  Until then, the artist and her 17 assistants and subcontractors had been working for the project in a Paris studio and partially completed the redesign at the property. Despite the fact that Pitt was no longer paying, according to her declaration, he asked her to continue\\xa0working.  \u201cOdile, I need you. Come here please. I need you to finish,\u201d Brad\\xa0Pitt\\xa0wrote in an email to Soudart, according the court documents published\\xa0by Liberation.  \u201cI don\u2019t know how things happen in France but in the United States, friends don\u2019t attack friends,\"\\xa0he wrote her in another email. \"I\u2019ve been nothing but a fan of your work. Do not attack. Let\u2019s finish the project and be proud of it. The work is too good to end on a bad note. Life is too short, my friend,\u201d he wrote to her in another.  In a third message,\\xa0he wrote: \u201cDon\u2019t waste time with legal action.

',\n 'Brad Pitt is not reuniting with Jennifer Aniston; claims of Angelina Jolie threatening him debunked  Amid news of a happy reunion between Brad Pitt and his children, a report claimed that the actor received some strict guidelines from his former wife Angelina Jolie to keep their brood of six away from his ex Jennifer Aniston.  The report was soon debunked by Gossip Cop that has seemingly provided some clarifications about the trio. According to the website neither Pitt has any intention of introducing his children to Aniston, nor is the Friends actress keen on meeting the Pitt-Jolie brood.  In fact, the gossip debunking site noted that the speculative story is based on rumours of Pitt-Aniston\\'s reunion, which itself are not true.  The site further claimed that Jolie did not have any outrageous demands like that of Pitt keeping his children away from Aniston.  InTouch Weekly had quoted its source as saying, \"As Angie and Brad\\'s divorce talks continue, she\\'s demanding that Brad agree to never have their children around Jen.\"  The magazine mentioned that the Allied actor had been leaning on Aniston as he is going through his divorce from Jolie. Additionally, the report claimed that Pitt and Aniston had apparently reconciled and were exchanging messages.  The original report also shed light on Pitt\\'s side of the story. \"Brad thinks the request is off the wall and irrational,\" the magazine quoted the source as saying. \"He isn\\'t going to cave in to Angie\\'s ridiculous demand... Angie is the one who filed for divorce, not him. And she will have to live with the consequences,\" the source claimed.  Jolie was last spotted along with four of her children in London, shopping for books.  Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt in September 2016 and the couple are working on the custody of their children in private.

Tickets for the event start at $250-per-person, which is a lower price point than many of the events she has held so far in her visits to the region to raise money. The costs rise to $500-per-person, up to $1,000-per-person, according to an invite. Co-hosts who raise $10,000 are invited to a reception with the candidate.  This will be Clinton's eighth fundraising visit to Los Angeles since announcing her presidential bid. She was in L.A. last month for a series of fundraisers, including one at the home of producer Ellen Goldsmith Vein and her husband, MarketShare CEO Jon Vein.  Her chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, last trekked to Los Angeles for fundraisers in October, including an event at the Hollywood nightclub Avalon.

More details have emerged regarding that Harry/Kendall date the One Direction star and budding model supposedly went on over the weekend.

The source added that Harry is a regular at said haunt, and although the pair didn\\'t hit the dancefloor, he left \"holding hands\" with Kendall when the One Direction hit What Makes You Beautiful came on - for fear of the pair being recognised.  Earlier the same day, \\'Kenry\\' caused a frenzy outside of NYC\\'s Gansevoort hotel when they were pictured leaving together.  With Harry (who was in town for his performance on SNL) dressed in a peacoat and bandana, and Kendall in a crop top, jeans and military jacket, the pair were swamped by fans as they left the hotel to get breakfast. They have reportedly stayed in touch ever since the American Music Awards, with a source telling E! News:  \"I\\'ve never seen Kendall happier and more fan friendly...They came off the elevator holding hands and then she stood and watched while he posed with fans.\"  Although both have vaguely denied the dating rumours (Kendall simply said \"He\\'s cool, yeah, he\\'s cool... You go out with one person, you\\'re automatically dating them\", whilst Harry told Piers Morgan \"dunno\" when asked to confirm their relationship status), this picture will no doubt send the rumour mill into a frenzy.  On Monday 25 November, we wrote...  Those Harry Styles and Kendall Jenner rumours? Probably not true, if both the parties involved are to be believed.   AKM-GSI Obviously the internet got a *little* carried away when the two were snapped leaving a dinner date together last week (because having dinner together = married in celeb-land), and both Kendall and Harry denied the dating rumours (if a little coyly) over the weekend.  At the AMAs, Kendall was asked by the E!\\'s Giuliana Rancic on the red carpet if she was indeed dating Harry. Her response?  \"We\\'re friends. He\\'s cool, yeah, he\\'s cool... You go out with one person, you\\'re automatically dating them.\"  Meanwhile, when quizzed on a possible romance by TV interviewer Piers Morgan, Harry said:\"I mean, we went out for dinner, but no, I guess.\"  And when asked if a romance could be in the pipeline after the one dinner date, Styles simply replied \"dunno\".  So not exactly a complete denial - but not a glowing declaration of love either.  Stay tuned to see if \\'Kenry\\' (yep, that\\'s what people are calling them) really is on the cards.  On Thursday 21 November, we wrote...  Has the world imploded, or did we actually just see this picture of Harry Styles and Kendall Jenner?

The pair met at the X Factor USA studios, where One Direction recorded their performance for the show this evening (or so says Unreality TV).   It may be a little premature to assume that these two are officially an item, but the Mail Online have already Christened the pair Kenry (the new Kimye, y\\'all), so we\\'re kind of hoping we\\'re set to see a trans-Atlantic teen power-couple confirm their romance in the coming weeks.

However, when it did, he laughed uncomfortably while she cried tears of joy. While the 47-year-old host fought back her tears on set, Seacrest tried to share some inspiring words with her, but couldn\u2019t handle seeing her cry.  \u201cI see the way you handle career, and most importantly family\u2026 and it\u2019s so impressive,\u201d he said of Ripa and her husband, Mark Consuelos. \u201cI am inspired by it, and anybody who knows you and watches you agrees.

In a filing earlier this month, a federal prosecutor argued that Joe Guidice\u2019s complaint was moot because he\u2019s being moved to a prison where he can challenge his immigration status.  The transfer to a prison in Allenwood, Pa., was expected to take place \"in the coming days,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jessica O\\'Neill said in a Nov. 6 filing in federal court here.  The 47-year-old is serving a 41-month sentence for conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud and other crimes.\\xa0His participation in a\\xa0residential drug abuse program could trim up to a year from a term set to end in March 2019, according to the federal Bureau of Prisons website.  Joe Giudice told an program screener that he was drinking \u201ctwo or\\xa0three bottles of wine daily\u201d and using marijuana \u201coccasionally\u201d before entering prison in March 2016, according to a court filing.\\xa0He also had a 2010 conviction for driving while intoxicated.  In rejecting his application for the residential program, authorities said Joe Giudice could not show he would be able to complete the final phase of \u201ccommunity confinement.\u201d They noted a detainer allowed immigration officials to take him into custody for a deportation hearing after his release from prison.  O\\'Neill\\'s filing said prison\\xa0officials initiated Joe Giudice\u2019s transfer\\xa0Sept. 27, three weeks after he brought his court challenge.

The rumors are all over the place: It\\'s been going on for \"a few months,\" and they were just together in Los Angeles, a source told Page Six on Wednesday evening.  \"They are really into each other because they have so much in common - from their Latin roots, to their love of New York\\xa0and their kids,\" the source said.  However, a People source said Wednesday night that Lopez and Rodriguez have been dating for only \"a few weeks.\"  \"For now, it\\'s just fun. She is single and enjoys dating,\" said that source, who described Lopez as \"excited.\"  The actress-singer-dancer, 47, and the newly full-time Fox Sports broadcaster, 41, are said to be headed for a \"romantic\" vacation in the Bahamas soon with another couple, the Terez Owens sports-gossip blog reported Monday.  \"He was with her in Vegas during this latest leg of her Planet Hollywood Vegas show,\" LoveBScott.com reported Wednesday. \"They were all coupled up behind the scenes, not public, but absolutely not hiding their relationship around close friends and family. It is definitely for real.\"  Rodriguez,\\xa0who played his final Major League Baseball game in August, took a full-time analyst job Tuesday with Fox Sports, where he previously had\\xa0been killing it as a guest host teamed with Pete Rose.  Of course, Lopez\\'s outings with Drake had dating rumors swirling earlier this year\\xa0too, though she put the kibosh on that for real Monday night, telling Trevor Noah ,\\xa0\"Let me clear this up:\\xa0I am not with Drake.\"  Rodriguez and Lopez each have two kids from previous relationships.

',\n \"'Au revoir for now': Kate and Wills bid a fond farewell to Paris after wowing the French during their two-day Brexit charm offensive   Duke and Duchess of Cambridge waved goodbye to Paris after their successful two-day tour  Earlier they cheered on Wales as they played their final Six Nations match To the dismay of the royal couple, France scored in the 100th minute and converted to win 20-18  They also met with victims of Nice and Bataclan terror attacks at military hospital as part of their tour  Next they visited the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay where they rekindled their love of art in the Impressionists' Gallery    The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\\xa0have bid a fond farewell to Paris after wowing the French people during their two-day Brexit charm offensive.  In a cheery final message before departing, a Kensington Palace spokesman said: 'What an incredible two days in Paris! Thank you to everyone who made the visit so memorable. Au revoir for now!'  Kate was handed a posy of lilac flowers by a pair of schoolchildren before the royal pair headed back home to the UK.  Earlier they endured a nail-biting finish to the Six Nations rugby today when victory was snatched from Wales after twenty minutes of overtime at the Stade de France.  Kate looked a picture of elegance in a double breasted Carolina Herrera coat and flashed a beaming smile as she chatted to William when the players entered the pitch.  As The Dragons took the lead the future Prince of Wales finally looked back in his comfort zone after appearing awkward since he was filmed dancing 'like a dad' in a club in Verbier, Switzerland earlier this week.  But he looked a bag of nerves as France pushed for the line in the dying seconds and Wales desperately held on in a bid to secure the win. To his dismay, France scored in the 100th minute and converted to win 20-18.  The couple were watching Wales' final Six Nations game as part of their two-day tour to Paris. This morning they met with war veterans and victims of the Nice and Bataclan terror attacks at the famous Les Invalides military hospital.  They then visited the Impressionists' gallery at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay before playing rugby with some French youngsters outside the Eiffel Tower. The couple will be flying back to the UK early this evening by private jet.  While attending their engagements this morning, the royals were but 10 miles from the scene of a shooting at Paris's\\xa0Orly airport.  But they are unaffected by the airport's closure as it is understood that the couple had always intended to use a different airport to get home.  The Duke and Duchess arrived for their first engagement in the centre of the city on time this morning and there was no obvious sign of increased security.  Kate was wearing a chic Chanel suit - a choice bound to delight fashionistas - in muted shades of black, grey and burgundy, with her hair loose, courtesy of her personal hairdresser, Amanda Tucker, who is travelling with her.  On her feet were a favourite pair of block-heeled burgundy Tod shoes, a more practical choice for the Paris cobbles than her normal high heels.  William and Kate were first visiting Les Invalides, an iconic French military hospital in the heart of the city.  They learnt about the important historic and current roles of the site, in particular its work supporting veterans undergoing rehabilitation programmes.  The Duke and Duchess also met victims and emergency service teams from the Bataclan and Nice terror attacks.  Among those they met were Jessica Bambal Akan, 25, who was shot seven times in the leg, hip and back as she dined with friends at La Belle Equipe restaurant in Paris.  There was also Kevin, a 28-year-old fireman, a concert-goer at the Bataclan, who was shot in the leg. Both have been undergoing rehabilitation at the hospital ever since.  Jessica said the encounter meant a great deal to both, who have found it invaluable to speak about their trauma and prove to the public that life goes on.  William told the Bataclan attack survivors: 'We think you are very strong and very brave, you've made amazing progress.'  The Duchess added she would be keeping an eye out for Jessica's work, after learning she is retraining to work in fashion.  Jessica, 25, said: 'At first [after the shooting] I was a bit shy and didn't want to talk about it because of all of the pain and grief.  'But now I want to say we are not only victims, we have lives, we have boyfriends, girlfriends, work. I want to speak about my friend who died to honour him, I want people to remember who he was.'  She was shot on her birthday as she dined with three female friends outside the restaurant, who all survived the attack. Her friend Victor Munoz, who was inside, was killed with one shot.  'We were very lucky,' she said of her friends outside. 'We all got shot and we all survived.'  The prince hailed the 'quick-thinking' of her boyfriend, who made a tourniquet for her leg on the scene.  'It's been very difficult,' she said. 'I like to move. I got through this because of my friends, my boyfriend, my family who helped me all the time.'  The Duchess asked how she had found readjusting to life after the accident.  'You feel like you're in a dream,' Jessica said, adding that she had tried to view her rehabilitation work as a job in the week, and enjoy her weekends as she did before.  She used her convalescence to learn Italian, and is now hoping to work organising fashion shows, telling the Duchess she had noted her Chanel outfit.  'I was ambitious, I am still ambitious,' she said, speaking in English. 'If I want revenge I must live and work and prove they [the terrorists] can't touch how we live in our great country. It sparked something: I realised you need to live.'  Kevin described how he attended a concert at the Bataclan, only to hear shouting and gunfire. They started shouting at the audience and opened fire.  'Anyone who shouted was shot, so I tried to be as quiet as possible. I was hit twice in the leg but lay there and kept quiet.'  Of meeting the Duke and Duchess, he said: 'It was a very positive experience because I was able to speak about this experience and what I went through.  'It feels very important to tell these stories and be listened to.' Asked how his emotional recovery had been, he told the Royal couple: 'It gave me a challenge, I like a challenge.' The Duchess said: 'You're a very brave man.'  The couple also spent time with the elderly inhabitants of Les Invalides, including one 101-year-old man who escaped the Nazis three times during the Second World War.  The Duchess was charmed by Colonel Jean Camus, 100, and Chief Petty Officer Georges Zwang, who will turn 102 in May.  Both reached for her hand to kiss it as they were introduces, prompting a smile from Kate.  Col Camus fought in France in 1939-40, was taken prisoner by the Germans, escpaed, joined the French resistance and escaped twice after being captured by Vichy forces and the Germans.  He managed to reach London in 1943 and served as an intelligence officer in the Central Bureau of Intelligence and Operations, before returning to France in August 1944 for the end of the war.  As they were introduced, the Duke exclaimed: 'As escape artist!' The veteran joked: 'I spent most of my life in jail. I could write a book.' The Duke replied: 'You should, it would be a bestseller.'  Col Camus added: 'I didn't expect to live so long, it's a surprise. I'm very glad to see you living and not on pictures as I saw the Queen and Charles. Thank you for listening.'  The veteran told the couple his wife had been made an MBE but the now suffers from Alzheimer's and could not make the journey to meet them. The Duchess said: 'Please send her our best wishes.'  They were also introduced to Chief Petty Officer Georges Zwang, who will turn 102 in May, served in the French navy from 1934-1940 and went on the join the Royal Navy. He then joined the Free French Forces and took part in the landing and battle of Provence where he was seriously injured.  Captain Stephane, from French Special Forces, severely injured during Operation Serval, joined them, along with Mrs Montcorge, 94. She was a lieutenant in the Free French Forces in 1943 in London and was appointed as liaison officer to General Patton commanding the 3rd US Army from June 1944 to the end of the war in 1945.  She told the Duke and Duchess she had been appointed after studying in the US.  Moving to the prosthetics room, the couple met Sergeant Phillippe, who was training in the French army as a dog handler when he had motorcycle accident in France leaving him with one prosthetic leg.  He has previously met the Duke, who presented him with medals at the Invictus Games, where he won a gold in the 100m and silver in the 200m in 2014, then a gold in the driving challenge and bronze in the 100m in 2016.  The Duke said: 'You are a huge inspiration for all the other guys.'  They also met two servicemen suffering from PTSD, to be known as Kevin and Francis, who discussed their mutual love of football and tonight's rugby match.  The Duke and Duchess, who was wearing a Chanel coat, were greeted by General Ract Madoux, governor of Les Invalides, who introduced them to a short history of the hospital, built in 1670 by Louis XIV for his veterans.  Today, Les Invalides houses around 80 pensioners, with a cutting-edge prosthetic department helping wounded servicemen and women.  William and Kate were also shown an ornate book, explaining how Charles II, king of England, wrote to Louis XIV to ask him to share with him the plan about the creation of the hospital.  It went on to inspire the foundation of the Royal Chelsea Hospital.  The Duke of Duchess of Cambridge rekindled their shared love of art today when they visited Paris's iconic Musee D'Orsay.  The couple first met when they both studied history of art at St Andrew's University in Scotland (although William later switched to geography) and were keen to visit the museum which houses the largest collection of Impressionist masterpieces in the world.  In a tender moment William and Kate even looked out onto the world's most romantic city through the face of a giant clock.  The couple toured the gallery on the second day of their two-day visit to Paris.  It remained open to the public throughout, prompting gasps from tourists who crowded round to take pictures and videos of the royals on their phones.  Home to some of the greatest works of French and European art produced in the 19th and 20th centuries, they had specifically asked to see one some of Claude Monet's most famous paintings including one of his water lilies series, painted in 1904.  The French impressionist painted around 250 oil paintings of the flower garden at his home in Giverny, which were the main focus of his artistic output during the last 30 years of his life.  The couple were also shown other Monet masterpieces, including his 1873 work Coquelicots or wild poppies and his 'parasol' paintings from 1886 titled, Essai de figure en plain-air femme a l'umbrelle. They stopped to take a close look at London, Houses of Parliament, which was inspired by Monet's 1871 visit to London when he was struck by the 'effects of fog on the Thames'.  William, 34, asked director Laurence des Cars: 'This is one of his most famous paintings isn't it?'  The 1904 masterpiece will go on loan to the Tate Britain later this year as part of an exhibition called: 'The Impressionists in London'.  The couple were also shown Monet's La Rue Montorgueil a Paris, a 1878 painting of a street which the Queen visited during her 2004 tour of France.  Art enthusiast Kate, 35, who graduated with a 2:1 in 2005, asked lots of questions, particularly about Edouard Manet's Olympia, a nude painted in 1863. Seemingly unfazed by the topless scene, William pointed to a black cat in the picture and was told it was a tongue in cheek addition.  Another painting that caught their eye was Gustave Caillebotte's Raboteurs de Parquet (1875) featuring half-naked men sanding a floor by hand.  A keen photographer, Kate has been patron of the National Portrait Gallery in London since 2012 and is also patron of a charity called The Art Room, which encourages disadvantaged children to express themselves through artistic endeavours.  Kate once said: 'I am a firm believer in the power of art to make a difference'.  William, whose father and grandfather are both keen artists, also studied history of art before switching to geography.  It is thought that Kate's support in convincing him to switch subjects rather than quit university altogether is what first drew them together.  Situated on the left bank of the Seine, the Musee D'Orsay is houses in the former Gare D'Orsay, a Beaux-Arts railway station built between 1898 and 1900.  It holds mainly French art dating from 1848 to 1914 including works by Monet, Manet, Degas, Renoir, Cezanne, Gaugin and Van Gogh.  Having been used as a railway station for more than 80 years, the decision was taken to close it down because its platforms were deemed too short for modern trains. In 1970 permission was granted to demolish the building but after an eight year row it was finally placed on the list of historic monuments and former French president Georges Pompidou gave the go ahead for it to be turned into an art gallery. It opened in 1986, with its original clocks remaining as a reminder of its transport heritage.  A man was shot dead at Paris Orly airport this morning after taking a soldier's gun and fleeing into a shop, taking aim at soldiers.  Less than two hours earlier, three police officers were shot at in a suburb in northern Paris by a gunman during a routine stop-and-search operation.  Police now believe the shooting in the northern Paris suburb of Stains, which left one officer injured, was carried out by the man who was later killed.  After fleeing the scene, the man stole a woman's car at gunpoint. \",\n 'Victoria Beckham finally addresses claims she\\'s trying for her FIFTH baby at 42 with husband David  The famous couple, who live in London, already have three sons and a daughter  Victoria Beckham has finally addressed claims she is set to try for another baby at the age of 42.  It has been widely reported that David is keen to add to their brood, which includes sons Brooklyn, 17, Romeo, 13, and Cruz, 11, along with their adorable four-year-old daughter Harper.  The footballing legend , 41, told chat show host Jonathan Ross in 2012: \"We might have one more or two more, you never know.  \"We\\'re not thinking about it yet, but if it happens, great. We\\'re enjoying the kids    as it is. It\\'s always a thought.  \"I mean, we\\'re busy people and we\\'re enjoying the four kids that we\\'ve got already and we\\'re lucky, we\\'re lucky to have four healthy children.\"  Sources close to the star even previously claimed she was preparing for pregnancy and had boosted her already spinach-heavy diet with \"broccoli and leafy greens rich in folic acid\".  But VB has now spoken out to Sunday Times Style Magazine , insisting she is NOT trying for another baby and doesn\\'t want any more children.  She said: \"No! I am done. People have been obsessed with it - she\\'s getting divorced, she\\'s pregnant, she\\'s getting divorced, she\\'s pregnant - ever since I met David.\"  Victoria admitted her kids get harder to handle as they get older - but the most important thing is to make sure that each child in the family gets the individual attention they need.  The star explained: \"I can never go to bed early because Brooklyn is always up and that\\'s when I get to see him, and then you\\'ve got Harper who is up super early.  \"So I do feel the that I\\'m being pulled in four different directions with the children. And then I have David and work, too. The truth is, it is hard.\"  The fashion designer, who went on to build her own empire after her success with the Spice Girls, admits she feels guilty if she misses something with the children, but it\\'s not something that happens often.  She added that her and David are \"always cuddling\" their kids, they communicate constantly and are very present in their lives, never missing a parents\\' evening or sports day.

Lopez tweeted a video teasing the musical, in which she will star, halfway through the East Coast performance of Hairspray Live! on Wednesday evening.

Bye Bye Birdie Live! - and Lopez\\'s involvement - was announced in October.

Yesterday was Kim Cattrall\\'s 60th birthday. She received plenty of good tidings from various news outlets and other actors, but the main question on everybody\\'s lips was whether her Sex and the City co-star would express her own well wishes. The answer was yes! Sarah Jessica Parker, the Carrie Bradshaw to Cattrall\\'s Samantha Jones, took to Instagram to very publicly declare that she was sending Cattrall love and all her very best on this, Cattrall\\'s special day.  \"Your ol\\' pal, fellow mischief maker, and \\'sister,\\' Sj,\" Parker signed her note. Sister didn\\'t really need to go in quotes, but point made. For years, there have been rumors of a feud between the two co-stars on the set of both the Sex and the City TV show as well as the two films the TV show begat. This Instagram finally put those rumors to bed.  The cause of the fight is usually pinned to money. \"The ladies reportedly had a big falling out in the show\\'s final season when Parker was paid considerably more than Cattrall on the HBO series,\" Us Weekly notes. Us reports that their alleged disagreement over money might have caused additional problems with production on the Sex and the City films.  Parker and Cattrall have denied rumors of a falling out and feud for years. In November 2009, Parker told Elle, \"I don\\'t think anybody wants to believe that I love Kim. I adore her. I wouldn\\'t have done the movie without her.\" Cattrall, in turn, told the magazine, \"She shines and she allows you to shine as well.\"  Cattrall was still being asked about the supposed beef in a January 2010 interview with the Daily Mail. \"I think Sarah was right: people don\\'t want to believe that we get on. They have too much invested in the idea of two strong, successful women fighting with each other. It makes for juicy gossip and copy. The truth of us being friends and getting along and happily doing our jobs together is where near as newsworthy. I think Sarah is fantastic. . . . She and I are sick of this. It\\'s exhausting talking about it, and a real bore.\"  Well, it\\'s been six years since that interview. Now we have social media, which allows us to get words and images straight from celebrities\\' mouths with no publication acting as a middle man to possibly filter or alter their quotes. So behold an image of Kim Cattrall posted by Sarah Jessica Parker on her birthday. Look at the caption in which Parker calls Cattrall a beauty and wishes her joy and an adventure-filled year.  It\\'s just like Carrie said: \"Friendships never go out of style.\" Or like Samantha said: \"I support you, and these bitches need to be put in their places.\" ',\n 'Mehgan James Speaks Out On Rob Kardashian Dating Rumors  Has Rob Kardashian found a new boo in Bad Girls Club alum Mehgan James? Media outlets began reporting last week that Rob and Mehgan were in the \"early stages\" in their relationship, with an anonymous insider telling In Touch, \"Rob\\'s been seeing Mehgan James for almost three months, and most of the Kardashians are very upset about it because Mehgan is known for being out of control and volatile. The Kardashians want Rob to find a woman who is kind and calm.\"  Shortly after the story began to gain traction, Rob denied even knowing who Mehgan was, writing on social media, \"Wait reading online about some chick I\\'m dating Megan something. Not true never even met her or heard of her before.\"  After retweeting Rob\\'s Twitter statement, Mehgan later addressed the rumors on her Instagram page, writing, \"Before any of you start defaming my character, I\\'m CLEARLY not dating Rob, nor have I ever confirmed that I was. You all just so happen to believe everything you read.\"  \"I posted one pair of Arthur George socks 2/3 weeks ago & now all of a sudden I\\'m a homewrecker, a fraud, a hoe,\" she continued. \"I do not control the media, BUT we all know who has the media on their payroll. Sooo... don\\'t point any fingers this way!\"  \"I\\'m just \\'Megan something,\\' that most of you never heard of,\" she went on, referencing Rob\\'s tweet. \"I don\\'t have that type of power. I was just as confused as everyone else and was told not to even entertain it.\"  But here\\'s where it gets interesting. TMZ reports that James was actually the one behind the rumors. According to their sources, Mehgan\\'s team leaked the story to the press in the hopes of building her following.  Mehgan then slammed that story on Instagram too, writing, \"I did not fake anything. Like I said I never confirmed that I was dating Rob. Any one that asked I told them it was not true. AND not to mention, the media is trying to make me look like the villain here when THEY are the ones who pieced together a story with no receipts. It takes two people to fake a relationship, any one who fakes a relationship by themselves is a complete idiot!!\"  Take a look at Mehgan\\'s full response below. ',\n 'Vanessa Lachey breaks silence amid \u2018DWTS\u2019 feud rumors  This dancing duo is trying to find their rhythm.  Vanessa Lachey is responding to rumors she and \"Dancing with the Stars\" partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy are at odds, admitting to Us Weekly that she lets him call the shots in the ballroom.  \"I just know that when I\\'m on set he\\'s my coach and I\\'m the student, so I listen a lot more and I don\\'t speak up as much because this is a field I don\\'t know,\" she said.  Lachey, 36, seemingly tried to put feud rumors to bed, telling Us Weekly that Chmerkovskiy has taught her a lot in a short period of time.  \"He\\'s trained me and taught me so many amazing wonderful new things just like any trainer would or teacher would,\" the mother of three said.  On Tuesday, People reported that the 37-year-old professional dancer and his \"Dancing with the Stars\" Season 25 partner were having \"a big chemistry issue.\"  \"They both have big personalities and that\\'s not always the best recipe for a good partnership,\" a source said.  A report from E! Online stated that Chmerkovskiy and Lachey \"can\\'t find middle ground.\"  Alan Bersten stepped in for Chmerkovskiy during Monday\\'s episode of \"Dancing with the Stars.\" Host Erin Andrews claimed that Lachey\\'s partner was out \"dealing with personal issues,\" but provided no further insight into what was going on.  The network confirmed to E! that he\\'ll return to the ballroom next week.  Rumors of an on-going behind the scenes battle between Chmerkovskiy and Lachey surfaced amid the lowest \"Dancing with the Stars\" ratings in at least two seasons.  Deadline reported that the show\\'s premiere was down 19% from Season 24 and Season 23 among adult viewers aged 18 to 49. Just 10.4 million people tuned in to the first night of competition, which left some fans questioning whether the rumored dancing drama was an attempt to draw in more viewers. ',\n 'This Is What Justin Bieber Did Instead of Going to the Grammys  Despite earning four nominations for his album Purpose, Justin Bieber had no plans to attend the Grammy awards this year. Rather than sitting at home alone, however, he decided to go out for sushi, and took fans along for the ride on his Instagram Story. (Other bystanders captured a few snaps of him walking into the restaurant as well for a full 360-degree look at what it\\'s like to have dinner with Justin.)  Of course, this move is a statement, and not a subtle one at that. TMZ reportedly spoke to a source that said Justin \"doesn\\'t think the Grammys are relevant or representative, especially when it comes to young singers.\"  Regardless, choosing not to show up to an award show for which you have received multiple nominations, and then to highlight that fact by doing something so overtly casual is pretty suspect.  However, this wasn\\'t the only questionable act that went down on Justin\\'s Instagram Live feed this weeknd. He also posted a video in which you hear someone ask him, \"Favorite song at the moment?\" He pauses, and then replies: \"\\'Starboy,\\' by The Weeknd,\" before bursting out into laughter, making it clear that the comment was sarcastic. You then hear the second voice in the video say: \"We\\'ve gotta end it now. That was too funny.\"  But we beg to differ, especially as it\\'s not the first time Justin\\'s taken a swipe at his fellow artist - and it\\'s that consistency that is concerning. This past January, he called The Weeknd\\'s music \"whack,\" so we already knew he wasn\\'t exactly a fan. It\\'s a significant comment mostly because it appears to be a bitter snide from an ex. As we all know, Selena Gomez has been spotted with The Weeknd, and though their relationship hasn\\'t been officially confirmed, there\\'s enough evidence \u2013\\xa0Justin\\'s response included \u2013\\xa0to speculate that the two are an item.  Dissing a fellow artist for no reason-\\xa0and especially when the question posed was open-ended and positive - isn\\'t cool. Doing it to your ex\\'s new partner is as petty as petty gets. If nothing else, it\\'s shown us that Justin has more #feelings about the situation than we realized. ',\n 'Kathy Griffin predicts career is over, says Trump \\'broke me\\'  Embattled comedian Kathy Griffin says she\\'s not afraid of Donald Trump and plans to keep making fun of him but maintained that she\\'s sorry for a video that depicted her holding a likeness of the president\\'s severed, bloody head.  At a rambling press conference Friday, Griffin tearfully predicted her career is over and said Trump \"broke me.\" Since the video was posted Tuesday, she has lost her job co-hosting CNN\\'s New Year\\'s Eve special and had all her upcoming comedy shows cancelled. Trump, first lady Melania Trump and Donald Trump Jr. have publicly criticized the video.  Griffin, who asserted that she has been contacted by the Secret Service, said the Trumps are \"trying to ruin my life forever.\"  \"The president, the first lady and the Secret Service have all made very clear their view on those thoughts,\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer said.  Griffin, 56, repeated her claim that the video was a parody, meant as a pointed comeback to Trump\\'s remark last summer that former Fox News Channel personality Megyn Kelly had \"blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of wherever.\"  \"I\\'m not laying down for this guy,\" she said in one defiant moment. \"I\\'m going to keep making jokes about this guy.\"  Republican Party spokesman Mike Reed called the press conference a \"desperate attempt\" to change the conversation.  \"Kathy Griffin\\'s career was over long before she attempted to make a disgusting joke about decapitating the President,\" Reed said. \"What she did was wrong and President Trump and his family have every right to condemn it.\"  The California GOP later sent out a fundraising email calling Griffin\\'s photo shoot disrespectful and obscene.  Griffin appeared surprised at the number of cameras and reporters in a packed conference room at her lawyer\\'s office, her hands shaking at one point when she took a sip of water. She switched between contriteness to combativeness during the press conference, during which she attempted several nervous jokes that drew laughs mostly from her attorney, Lisa Bloom.  Bloom said the comedian has a First Amendment right to make fun of the president.  \"Whether or not you get, or like, her artistic expression, in America, Kathy has the right to parody the president,\" Bloom said. \"She never imagined it would be misinterpreted as a threat of violence against Trump.\"  Bloom, a former truTV anchor and lawyer Gloria Allred\\'s daughter, has represented Wendy Walsh, who has accused former Fox News Channel personality Bill O\\'Reilly of hurting her career after she spurned his advances. O\\'Reilly has denied the accusations  Backlash against Griffin has continued to grow. Griffin said five of her performances have been canceled this week.  Venues in New Jersey, New York, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and California canceled upcoming shows. The Community Arts Theater in Williamsport, Pa., posted on its website that the show had been dropped \"due to the recent controversy surrounding Kathy Griffin and the concern for the safety and security of our patrons and staff.\"  Sen. Al Franken also dis-invited Griffin from an event promoting his new book, \"Giant of the Senate.\"  \"After hearing from many Minnesotans who were rightfully offended, I\\'ve come to the conclusion that it would be best for her not to participate in the event we had previously scheduled,\" the Minnesota Democrat said Thursday, a day after he had said she was still welcome. \"I understand why Minnesotans were upset by this, and I take that very seriously.\"  He said what Griffin did \"was inappropriate and not something that should be anywhere in our national discourse.\"  An endorsement deal with Squatty Potty also ended.  Though Griffin apologized within hours of the images appearing online Tuesday, they were met with swift and widespread condemnation.  Trump later tweeted that Griffin \"should be ashamed of herself\" for posting the images.  New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Thursday called Griffin \"disgusting\" and said the photo was \"completely outrageous.\"  Even Anderson Cooper, her CNN co-host for the New Year\\'s Eve show, condemned the images. Griffin said she has not spoken to Cooper since, and appeared visibly upset and struggled to speak when fielding questions about Cooper.  The comic has faced controversies before for her abrasive humor, but none as widespread as the one generated by Tuesday\\'s images.  This story has been corrected to show that Griffin accused the Trumps of \"trying to ruin my life forever,\" not \"my rights.\"  AP writer Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this story.

The Bodyguard Claims He \"Fathered\" Brangelina\\'s Kids Since the news of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\\'s split, many have wondered what will happen to the couple\\'s six kids. Will they stay with mom, or with dad, or some combination of the two? Or could a third person have parenting rights as well? Enter Mark Billingham, the star couple\\'s bodyguard. Billingham said he basically \"fathered\" the children, according to Us Weekly.  Of course, Billingham is not asking for custody \u2014 and even if he did, he probably wouldn\\'t be awarded it, considering he\\'s not related by blood to the kids, and he was only with the family for 18 months. But it\\'s interesting that the guard would choose to come forward with the details of his employments now, especially amidst some rumors of Pitt\\'s shortcomings as a father.  According to Billingham, the couple\\'s primary concern was their children. They wanted the guard to keep the six kids \u2014 Maddox, 15; Pax, 12; Zahara, 11; Shiloh, 10; and 8-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne \u2014 safe, particularly from kidnapping.  A former member of the British army, Billingham described the couple\\'s intense protectiveness of their children. Pitt and Jolie didn\\'t want the kids spending time or going anywhere with strangers. They were also worried about stalkers who could endanger the lives of their children, according to The Sun. But Billingham said he was was one member of their staff that the couple allowed to get close to the kids, according to the Sun:  Billingham said he became so close with the kids that he was an \"unofficial\" father. But he didn\\'t throw any shade at Pitt, whose parenting style some questioned after Jolie filed for divorce. E! News reported that Pitt was under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Department of Children and Family Services as a result of allegations that the actor verbally and physically abused the children. The allegations have not been substantiated.  From what Billingham describes of his relationship to the couple and their children, it\\'s clear that Pitt and Jolie want what\\'s best for their children. In her divorce filing, Jolie did cite the well-being of the kids as a reason for the split. Pitt, in his response, also emphasized his commitment to the couple\\'s children. Hopefully, with the right support system \u2014 perhaps including people like Billingham \u2014 the kids will get through the divorce alright. ',\n 'rad Pitt attends charity concert with Sting in rare public appearance following split from Angelina Jolie  Brad Pitt reemerged in the spotlight Saturday after keeping a low profile for months following his split from Angelina Jolie.  The A-list actor seemed to be in strong spirits as he made the rounds at a charity concert in Malibu, where a bevy of stars turned out to raise awareness for a serious skin disease called epidermolysis bullosa.  Pitt, 53, attended the Rock4EB! Charity gig with his pals, musicians Sting and Chris Cornell, who headlined the event. The \"Allied\" actor was seen socializing throughout the evening, shaking hands and sharing laughs with others on hand, according to People.  He later took the stage during the concert, where he jokingly imitated Sting in front of the laughing crowd.  \"When I started my career back in, uh...\" he joked. \"When I started making wine back in, uh ... very good wine, by the way.\"  Pitt also introduced Cornell, the singer and songwriter behind grunge band Soundgarden, before he took the stage, calling him a \"someone I\\'ve known for quite a while and that I\\'m a huge fan of.\"  Pitt was far from the only big name at Saturday\\'s charity event, which was sponsored by jewelry company Alex and Ani and hosted by Zach Galifianakis. Courteney Cox, Kaley Cuoco and David Spade were among the other stars in attendance.  The actor\\'s appearance at the benefit concert comes less than a week after he surprised viewers at the Golden Globes by presenting the film \"Moonlight,\" which was produced by his Plan B Entertainment company.  Pitt mostly disappeared from the public eye following his contentious split from Angelina Jolie in September after two years of marriage and 12 years together overall.  Jolie currently has physical custody of their six kids through a temporary agreement, but the two stars continue to attempt to work out a permanent plan.  The duo agreed last week to handle the remainder of their court battle in private, weeks after one of Jolie\\'s previous filings became available for public viewing. ',\n 'Kevin Hart and Eniko Parrish welcome baby  The comedian tweeted Tuesday that his wife, Eniko Parrish, had given birth to their son.  \"God is truly amazing....Kenzo Kash Hart was born at 1:45am ,\" Hart tweeted. \"He is Healthy & already smiling. Thank you all for your prayers!!!! We love & appreciate ya.\"  It\\'s the first child for the couple. Hart has two children -- a daughter, Heaven, 12, and a son, Hendrix, 10, with ex-wife Torrei Hart.  Hart\\'s children were attendants when the couple married in a lavish ceremony last year after dating for several years. ',\n 'Zayn on Taylor Swift: \"I Think She Deserves Her Success\"  Former One Direction member and perennial pop heartthrob Zayn Malik is notoriously guarded. But in an interview with The Fader following the release of his new single with Sia \u201cDusk Till Dawn,\u201d he did offer up a positive review of fellow pop star Taylor Swift, with whom he collaborated on the chart-topping single \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Live Forever\u201d in late 2016.  \u201cI rate her as an artist, I think she\u2019s cool, I think she\u2019s successful, and I think she deserves her success because she\u2019s worked hard,\u201d Malik said about Swift. \u201cThat\u2019s just how I look at it. I did a song with her, it was fun, she was professional.\u201d  Malik also noted that Swift is more than just a one-off collaborator and professional contact: his girlfriend, Gigi Hadid, is famously part of Swift\u2019s squad. \u201cShe gets on with my girlfriend, they\u2019re good friends,\u201d he noted. \u201cI don\u2019t have a bad word to say about her. She\u2019s cool.\u201d (He did not comment on her most recent music.)  In general, Malik seems thoroughly nonplussed by media attention and the hullabaloo around both his own activities or those of other celebrities in the pop sphere. \u201cI don\u2019t pay too much attention to what people even say about me. I just tend to take it for what it is when I meet them people in real life and have a conversation with them. If they\u2019re cool with me, then I base my relationship on that,\u201d he said.  He also teased an upcoming album to follow debut work Mind of Mine, with a release date yet to be set.

On Tuesday, the \u201cLive\u201d co-host recorded and expressed how much he enjoyed a subway singer performing The Temptations\u2019 \u201cI Got Sunshine\u201d and Ben E. King\u2019s \u201cStand By Me\u201d while riding the underground rails with everyday New Yorkers. See the video below.  In footage he shared on Twitter, Seacrest could be seen singing along to \u201cStand By Me\u201d and showing how happy he was watching the subway singer. Alongside the video, he wrote, \u201cSometimes the best shows in ny are on the subway.\u201d For the most part, it seems other riders left the big TV star alone as he sat on the subway. The former \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d host also said the singer was \u201cthe man,\u201d before noting he needed to reach into his pocket and give the entertainer some money. \",\n 'Aid worker claims Angelina Jolie adopted son Maddox using fake details  A Cambodian aid worker is making extraordinary claims about Angelina Jolie\\'s 2003 adoption of eldest son Maddox Jolie-Pitt.  Mounh Sarath, 51, told Britain\\'s The Sun on Sunday that he signed official papers in Cambodia claiming he was Maddox\\'s father in order to help speed along the boy\\'s adoption all those years ago.  He also claims he still has legal power of attorney over the now-teenager and showed The Sun on Sunday the adoption document filed with a court in Cambodia\\'s Battambong province in August 2003 to back up his claims.  He explained the lie, telling the paper, \"She had to change his name, so the only way was for me to do it. I said he\\'s my son.\"  \"In court documents, Maddox is still my son,\" he said. \"She never cleared this up.\"  Despite his claims, there is no evidence that either Angelina, 41, or then-husband Billy Bob Thornton, 61 -- who was also involved in Maddox\\'s adoption before he and Angelina divorced -- knew what Mounh did.  According to MailOnline, Angelina has previously said she went to \"great lengths to ensure Maddox did not have a living birth mother in Cambodia\" and that she would \"never rob a mother of her child.\"  Maddox\\'s adoption took place at a time when the United States was imposing tougher restrictions on adopting kids from Cambodia because of trafficking concerns.  Lauryn Galindo -- the adoption agent who handled Angelina and Maddox\\'s case -- spent time in prison after reportedly falsifying the names, birth dates and birth places of Cambodian children who were adopted by Americans. (She denied this at the time, telling ABC\\'s \"20/20,\" \"I have never been involved or charged with anything other than paperwork errors. And that\\'s what I pled to, that\\'s what I\\'m going to go to prison for.\"  While making his serious claims, Mounh -- who met Angelina through charity work -- also revealed he and the star have since fallen out. \"I would be happy if Cambodia didn\\'t see her again,\" he said.  Angelina was in Cambodia in February to promote \"First They Killed My Father,\" a movie she directed for Netflix about the Khmer Rouge and Cambodian genocide. Maddox worked on the film.  Neither Angelina nor soon-to-be ex-husband\\xa0Brad Pitt, who legally adopted Maddox after settling down with Angelina, have commented on the claims.  In addition to Maddox, the former couple are also parents to son Pax, 13, who was adopted from Vietman; daughter Zahara, 12, who was adopted from Ethiopia; and biological children Shiloh, 10, who was born in Namibia, plus 8-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne, who were born in France.',\n 'Kim Kardashian flips over paparazzi photos showing her in a bikini on vacation: \\'I literally don\\'t look like this!\\'    In April, Kim\\xa0Kardashian West\\xa0went on\\xa0vacation in Mexico to celebrate her sister Kourtney\\'s birthday.\\xa0Paparazzi photos of Kim at the beach quickly surfaced online, prompting some people\\xa0to\\xa0criticize the reality TV star\\'s cellulite.  A teaser for\\xa0this week\\'s\\xa0upcoming\\xa0episode of \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" shows Kim reacting to the photos after her former assistant and Kardashian West Brands\\xa0COO Stephanie\\xa0Shepherd\\xa0came across them on her phone.  \"Oh my god,\" Kim said, as she looked at the photos while\\xa0lounging by the pool with her friends. \"Like, I don\\'t get it!

And if they\\'re not, like, perfect people just, like, body-shame you. [...] For people to just think that\\'s OK is so frustrating.\"  Kim then goes inside to \"untag\" herself in all the pictures that have been posted.  Watch the clip, which we first saw on E! News, below:  When\\xa0the\\xa0photos first appeared, Kim had a very different public\\xa0reaction\\xa0to the comments about the photos, sending a body-positive tweet that appeared to rise above the criticism she received.  Although Kim\\'s\\xa0initial response was celebrated, she was criticized for\\xa0claiming that the pictures were Photoshopped\\xa0on \"The View\" in June.\\xa0In the same interview, she said\\xa0that the photos\\xa0encouraged her to start working out more.  \"I saw these awful photos of myself when I was on a trip in Mexico and people were Photoshopping them and sharpening them, and they\\'re the worst photos,\" she said during her appearance on the TV show. \"I definitely was not in my best shape. I hadn\\'t worked out in about 12\\xa0weeks.\"  She continued: \"I was already not feeling like myself and then when people were like sharpening [the photos] and making them look way worse, and then those were going around, I was like \\'OK, I\\'m going to get it together.\\'\"  Of course, Photoshopped or not,\\xa0cellulite is a totally normal part of a woman\\'s body.

Confused? Yep, you're not the only one.  On Friday night, the Canadian crooner and Ventura were seen arrived at French Montana's birthday party together in Los Angeles, with sources confirming to US Weekly that the musician spent the majority of the night cosying up to Bieber's former love interest.  'The Weeknd was there hand in hand with Yovanna Ventura all night,' a source told the publication.  'They arrived together. They were holding hands. He was there for a solid two hours with her and everywhere they went they held hands.'  Another source said: 'He was parading her around. He was trying to make it obvious that he was with someone. They were pretty affectionate and were together the entire night.'  If this isn't a snub to both Gomez and Bieber post break-up, we don't know what is.  The 30-year-old's PDA with Ventura comes amid news Selena 'liked' an Instagram photo of her ex, at the party, sending the 'Fetish' singer's fans in a full-blown meltdown.  Some believe it's proof the 25-year-old and her ex boyfriend have left things on good terms amid her rumoured reconciliation with Bieber.  Meanwhile, sources have told People that the 25-year-old and the 'Sorry' singer are back together but are keeping their cards closer to their chest when it comes to the pair's relationship.

I\\'ve been fortunate enough to work with Emmy award-winning actress Jane Lynch to help animals and people in need through K9s for Warriors and The Rescue Train (see Glee\\' Star Jane Lynch Helps Place Dogs with PTSD Soldiers and Actress Jane Lynch Raises Awareness for Pets in Need).  The star power at my next pet-rescue event was just taken up a notch at the 2nd annual fundraiser for the\\xa0Saving SPOT! Rescue.  The\\xa0SPOT!\\xa0storefront from which the rescue operates, is the impassioned business of Lizzie Scherer. She and her family and staff work tirelessly to help ensure that dogs up for adoption are healthy and placed in suitable forever homes.\\xa0The event\\xa0was held at the Thomson Hotel in Beverly Hills, CA.  Media icon Ellen DeGeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi, lent their luminous presence to the cause by hosting the live auction where they auctioned off the opportunity to travel on a Toms shoes and eyewear\\xa0trip to deliever shoes to children. The\\xa0jovial and convincing nature of Degeneres brought the value of the auction item up to over $8,000, all of which was ultimately donated to Saving SPOT! Rescue.  DeGeneres has supported the Saving Spot! Rescue for years and even features the rescue\\'s adoptable dogs on her EllenTV.com website. Recently, she posted\\xa0profiles of English Cocker Spaniels hilariously named Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha after HBO\\'s Sex and the City.  Present at the SPOT! event were a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors of cute dogs in need of adoption. Degeneres and De Rossi were photographed holding the puppies and were particularly drawn to a petite puppy having a jet-black coat.  Did DeGeneres and de Rossi take another pooch home to add to their growing number of canine and feline family members? I don\\'t know for sure, but what I do know is that the couple already cares for Mabel, a black Standard Poodle, and Wolf, a mixed breed suspected to be a hybrid of Poodle-Maltese.  Although Mabel is a pure-breed dog, she was reportedly rescued from a less-than-ideal living environment. According to an interview with peoplepets.com (EXCLUSIVE! Ellen DeGeneres Chats About Her Pets), Mabel \"was kind of a show dog early in her career, and, like many models, got too old for it. She was in a kennel, she was not needed anymore so we got her from this guy. She was definitely not in a horrible situation; she was in a situation where she needed a home.\"  Wolf also has a unique rescue story, as DeGeneres says, \"I wasn\\'t looking for a dog. I happened to spot a man that was not completely balanced. He was a guy that was mistreating the dog. He was swinging the dog around and doing things to it and I went over to him and offered to give him some money. It was a long, long story but the guy was very strange and had smuggled the dog in from Mexico and was not planning on doing things to it, so it took me hours to get that dog from that guy. Anyway, Wolf was in pretty bad shape. He was tiny ... he was [malnourished], he couldn\\'t stand up. His back legs couldn\\'t support him because he had never been put down and maybe damaged on the way in, being smuggled in. It\\'s just the craziest story. But he\\'s just the craziest, sweetest dog now. Just a love!\"  Cats are also part of the family and have the unique names Chairman, Charlie, and George. \"Charlie has a dog personality where she has to be wherever people are and follow you from room to room,\" according to DeGeneres.  A variety of other celebrities were also on hand to support Saving SPOT! Rescue, including:  I had a very pleasant conversation with actress Allison Janney, who I met a few years back at a Los Angeles dog park after she showed interest in my dog Cardiff. After reminding her of our meeting, Janney told me all about the canine companions with whom she shares her home. Hopefully, I\\'ll soon be caring for her dogs as my patients.  The night wrapped up with happy humans having congregated for a good cause and raised lots of money to help support the ongoing efforts of Saving Spot! Rescue.

The American designer is believed to be creating a gown and an ensemble for the future first lady, according to the magazine. Melania previously wore a $4,000 white Ralph Lauren pantsuit on Election Night.  Lauren also became Hillary Clinton's favored designer during her own presidential campaign. He designed the famed white pantsuit she donned at the Democratic National Convention, as well as several of her other outfits on the trail.  Almost 37.8 million viewers watched Barack Obama's inauguration in 2009. Isabel Toledo, the designer of Michelle Obama's yellow dress and coat, became known worldwide overnight after 25 years of non-mainstream work.  The future first lady could wear the Ralph Lauren outfit during the day and change into the gown for the evening's celebrations, which include a 1,500-people candlelight dinner at Union Station Thursday.  Melania had purchased her Election Night jumpsuit at Ralph Lauren's Madison Avenue store.  Lauren's staff is also believed to be designing pieces for other members of the Trump family, according to Women's Wear Daily.  No further details were provided as to the president-elects inauguration outfit. A source at Brioni, his favored brand of Italian suits, told the magazine they hadn't made a custom outfit for the occasion.

Jost was most notably linked with actress Rashida Jones (the internet seems to be a bit murky on this relationship but suspects it was sometime around 2013).  Best wishes to Jost and Johansson \u2014 hopefully they make it work! \",\n 'Kris Jenner Is Concerned for Future Generations of Kardashians  Kris Jenner, mother of six and grandmother to six more, is a busy matriarch. Since the start of her family\u2019s reality show in 2007, it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s been keeping one eye trained on the reality-TV circus and the other on how that circus affects her family. During a new reality-TV roundtable with The Hollywood Reporter, Jenner said she worries about how her six grandchildren will be affected by the family business.  \u201cIt\u2019s my grandchildren who I worry about because I have six of them; the oldest just turned 7, and my youngest is 6 months old, and they don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I worry, I do, because it is such a bullying environment.\u201d  Jenner said her daughters\u2019 \u201cthick skin\u201d has helped propel them forward despite the maddening trolls of reality TV. These are, after all, the sisters whose public fights, tears, and meme-worthy breakdowns made them one of the genre\u2019s biggest success stories. They chose a public life, though. Their children did not, but they\u2019re still placed in front of the cameras\u2014hence Jenner\u2019s fears about what she started.  Her grandkids, Mason, Penelope, and Reign Disick, North and Saint West, and Dream Kardashian, have become celebrities themselves by birthright alone. Anyone recall North\u2019s debut diva moment, as she rolled through the Paris airport on a Frozen-themed suitcase, wearing a Yeezus Tour jacket?  During the roundtable, Jenner leaned on her original philosophy for the show (never to hold back) as she talked about how her life as a reality star has evolved.  \u201cWe decided as a family that if we\u2019re going to do this, we would just show everything. And one of the best decisions I made not only as a producer of the show, but as one of the stars of the show, was to say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to remove anything.\u2019 With that philosophy, I told the kids, \u2018Don\u2019t get on the Internet.\u2019 Now it\u2019s so amplified . . . you expect it now from the trolls.\u201d  She added that Kim Kardashian West \u201cleads the pack\u201d as the \u201cqueen of thick skin,\u201d modeling for everyone else how to face the Internet and other critics alike.  As they grow, the Kardashian grandchildren will have a whole new host of technologies to battle (imagine trolls with drones), but North just might have inherited the thick-skinned genes to handle it. She already knows how to tell the paparazzi to back off. ',\n 'Kim Kardashian Opens Up to About Life After the Paris Robbery  This morning, Kim Kardashian West is a few minutes late to breakfast because she can\u2019t get this gel-mask thing off her face. She\u2019s staying in a room in the upper reaches of the Baccarat Hotel in midtown Manhattan. A room with a giant bed in it, in which she slept, butt to butt, with her four-year-old daughter, North. And in that room she applied a mask \u2014 of the cosmetic variety, not the Halloween variety \u2014 only to discover she couldn\u2019t really get it off. Where did she get this gold gel-mask thing that\u2019s supposed to make your skin healthier? Man, when you\u2019re Kim Kardashian West, you don\u2019t know where everything comes from. People just give you stuff. The vaults and doors and express-delivery accounts of the world open and a free flow of stuff just washes over you. Kim tries to enjoy it, because that\u2019s the enlightened thing to do. But right now she\u2019s upstairs in her room trying to separate her face from the free gel-mask thing.  It is 8 a.m. I wait for her in the sumptuous lobby. Baccarat, for those who do not shop for $10,000 vases, is a French company that makes crystal. And being inside the Baccarat Hotel is like being inside a fine crystal lamp where an urbane French genie who wears Louis Vuitton suits lives. Here\u2019s the kind of place it is: $46 from Le Menu du Petit D\u00e9jeuner at the Petit Salon in the hotel gets you two eggs, potatoes, bacon, juice, and\u2026coffee! There is an actual crown on display on a shelf full of curios and crystals, unless it\u2019s the world\u2019s most bejeweled serving dome.  But Kim K. does not make me wait too long. Seven minutes after 8, she arrives. She looks somehow naked. Her face, anyway. It is scrubbed clean, I guess from the mask removal. There is a stunning absence of makeup, except for some lip balm that she tells me she got in Iceland. Which is ironic given that the 36-year-old recently launched her own makeup line (it\u2019s called KKW Beauty ). Predictably, she has utterly crushed the stuff-for-your-face market the way she has crushed all other markets. I think part of the reason her facial nudity is so striking is that being simple and unadorned isn\u2019t really her role. Her role is more queen of America . (Married to the king of\u2026hip-hop fashion, intellectual provocation, and possible public-\\xadinsanity performance art?) Queen of Instagram, queen of a certain type of television, queen of relevance. The queen of Calabasas, California! Which, if you don\u2019t know, is the Mount Olympus of our time. Will Smith lives there. And Justin Bieber and Drake and the Rock and the Osbournes. And if you think about who\u2019s the queen of those people, wouldn\u2019t you say Kim Kardashian West?  I know, you\u2019re probably wondering what she was wearing. You\u2019re probably saying to yourself: What did she eat for breakfast? I\u2019m not going to make you wait for it. She wears this cool, Rocky Balboa retro gray cotton hoodie with the 1980 American Olympic team logo on it and gray sweatpants. And she orders scrambled eggs with tomatoes, mushrooms, and onions mixed in, an English muffin, and some English breakfast tea with loads of honey. Did she eat everything? Don\u2019t be afraid to wonder. If you don\u2019t care whether Kim Kardashian West ate her English muffin, you need to go back to Kim Kardashian West school so you can appreciate the wonderful granular gossipyness that\u2019s part of what\u2019s so enjoyable about knowing everything about Kim K. before you come back here with your too-good-to-want-to-know-if-she-eats-her-English-muffin-ness.  \u201cI\u2019m, like, the most fit I\u2019ve ever been,\u201d she says. How do you get in shape if you\u2019re Kim K.? The same way you do everything: Instagram. You go and you find \u201cthis bodybuilder on Instagram\u201d and you contact her. You find someone who, as Kim K. tells it, \u201chad an amazing transformation after she had a baby.\u201d And Kim K. happened to be in the market for a really amazing transformation after giving birth. Now Kim\u2019s working out an hour and a half a day.  Kim Kardashian West \u2014 I don\u2019t want to scandalize you \u2014 has had her picture taken nearly naked before. For Playboy . And completely nude for Paper, GQ, and W magazines. And that doesn\u2019t even include the original document of her fame, the storied Ray J sex tape. \u201cMy publicist would say to me, \u2018You\u2019re not getting naked. I have to be there,\u2019\\u200a\u201d she says. I suggest that if your publicist keeps warning you not to get naked, she must know you\u2019re always in danger of getting naked.  Is there an age limit for the naked photo shoot?  \u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m like, I\u2019m going to tone it down. But then I\u2019m like, Wait, I can\u2019t be doing it in 10 years, so \u2014 I might as well. I don\u2019t know what the age cutoff is.\u201d  We know everything about Kim Kardashian West. She has shown us everything. Talked about everything. Many times. In different languages. Kim has talked about basketball, and baby poop, and having no idea where pickles come from, and the texture of cardboard, and Kanye, and Caitlyn Jenner , and her sister\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s drug problems. Recently, on her show, we even watched her share the story of how difficult her pregnancy and birthing process was and how she\u2019s looking at some alternatives to carrying her next kid herself. Have you ever considered, besides the solipsism, the bravery in that? You know the unflinching way she takes off her top in front of a camera? Or wears a $75 billion dress? That\u2019s how unflinchingly she talks about the fragility of her own human body. It\u2019s feminist. It\u2019s a PSA. Here, in this glass-enclosed beveled luxury maze, while wealthy French businessmen finish eating their $46 toast, I ask if she\u2019s thought about a third child. And she retains this unblinking steady-state feline eye contact and a sense of self-assurance that could freeze water while she says, \u201cI would like to, but I\u2019ve had lots and lots of complications. I had preeclampsia. And then I also had something called placenta accreta. We\u2019ve explored surrogacy. We\u2019re thinking about it.\u201d  I get the vibe from her that, just as she has the crushing instincts necessary to lay waste to our culture and create an America in her image (or is it that she\u2019s created America\u2019s image?), she also has the instinct to preserve the humanity of her family.  \u201cWe don\u2019t do gifts,\u201d she says when I ask her if she worries about her kids growing up with too much. \u201c[Kanye and I] talk about it all the time, about not getting too much and trying to be as grounded and well rounded as possible.\u201d She holds herself to the same standard. \u201cI don\u2019t like presents anymore,\u201d she says. \u201cWe just did absolutely nothing [for our anniversary]. We spent two days in Santa Barbara, and we slept.\u201d Then she remembers: \u201cYou know what? I think we went to IHOP. That\u2019s what we did.\u201d  And then she tells me this story. A motherhood story. It\u2019s about the time last year, in Paris, when she was held at gunpoint and bound and robbed in a hotel by masked gunmen. Well, she tells me, she\u2019d been scared to go on that trip. She was afraid of a terrorist attack. She\u2019d never experienced anxiety like that before. She even went to a therapist about it. And North, sensing her mother\u2019s anxiety, wanted to reassure her.  \u201cShe gave me a little plastic treasure box, and she put her little jewels in it \u2014 like fake little plastic jewels \u2014 and she was like, \u2018Mommy, this will keep you safe when you go to Paris.\u2019\\u200a\u201d It is something that, despite all the jewels and Calabasas houses and red carpet gowns and original Basquiats and Rolls-Royces and pairs of Yeezy boots she has, penetrates down into the depths of Kim Kardashian West\u2019s humanity, which, at least after spending a few hours with her, I believe is very much there.  \u201cTo have something really sweet like that is more important to me than all the jewelry,\u201d she says. She tells me she takes it everywhere with her.  Around us, European businessmen sign their checks, step into hushed elevators and are whisked to meetings with continental vampires. Kim K. says she\u2019s going to see what North is up to. I\u2019m trying to figure out what\u2019s weird about seeing her in person, at this phase of her life. And I think it\u2019s that she wears her crown lightly. I guess it\u2019s that she\u2019s chill. Which doesn\u2019t seem like the one word you\u2019d use for Kim K. I guess it\u2019s that she\u2019s really a mom now. She is a beautiful, worldly 36-year-old woman drinking the last of a cup of English breakfast tea before going out into the world to see to her empire, with her four-year-old child at her side, bearing witness to the domination but never expecting, you know, presents.

E! News\u2019s Catt Sadler caught up with Carrey on the red carpet of the Harper\u2019s Bazaar Icons party Friday night, and the two-minute clip of their exchange has been percolating on Twitter ever since. After she pointed out that she\u2019d never seen him at the biannual spectacle, he explained to her the following: \u201cThere\u2019s no meaning to any of this. So I wanted to find the most meaningless thing that I could come to and join and here I am.\u201d Watch Sadler\u2019s eyes as she fully comprehends what she\u2019s about to endure.  \u201cCelebrating icons,\u201d Carrey says. \u201cBoy, that is just the absolute lowest aiming possibility we could come up with. Do you believe in icons?\u201d  When Sadler started to answer, he interjected, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in personalities. I don\u2019t believe that you exist, but there is a wonderful fragrance in the air.\u201d  Carrey then looked in the camera and gave his speech, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in icons. I don\u2019t believe in personalities. I believe that peace lies beyond personalities, beyond invention and disguise, beyond the red \u2018S\u2019 that you wear on your chest, that makes bullets bounce off. I believe that it\u2019s deeper than that. I believe we\u2019re a field of energy dancing for itself, and\u2014uh\u2014I don\u2019t care.\u201d (It wasn\u2019t exactly extemporaneous poetry; the lines are borrowed from a commencement speech he gave in 2014 at Iowa\u2019s Maharishi University of Management).  Yes, he sounded like a liberal-arts student on a particularly mellow week night. And it\u2019s not clear whether he sensed the irony in himself saying all of that while attending the party and wearing a flashy tailored suit (Asked about his get-up, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t get dressed up. There is no me. There\u2019s just things happening.\u201d).  Carrey\u2019s referendum, despite its slightly unbearable pitch, rings somewhat true amid the backdrop of destruction caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. And Charlottesville. And the general mood of melancholy that has settled over the country like a thick fog. It\u2019s hard to see where the art and commercialism and spectacle of N.Y.F.W. fits into all that. Designers themselves have struggled with that question since the 2016 election, as have many creators in other fields. The world looks different now than it did even last February, and it will somersault a thousand more times before the clothing parade gears again up next February. (But, make no mistake, the parade will go on.)  But that\u2019s not even it, really, Carrey said. \u201cIt\u2019s not our world. We don\u2019t matter. That\u2019s the good news.\u201d Great!

But like most families, they prefer to do weekends closer to home, and paid a visit to their local mall in Los Angeles yesterday, stopping by the Build-A-Bear Workshop in coordinating outfits.  Kim kept things cool in an elevated take on the army surplus jacket, adding a touch of contrast to her all-black aesthetic. Yeezy 950 duck boots gave the ensemble an added utilitarian vibe and picked up on Kanye's lo-fi look; he was dressed in an oversize jacket, skinny jeans, and gray Yeezy 750 high-tops, complementing his wife's style. It was little North, though, who really put her best foot forward. The 2-year-old budding style maven has demonstrated her fashion acumen in the past with custom Fallon chokers and statement coats, and this latest look had tons of baby-grunge attitude: Note the faux fur topper, Thrasher tee, and leopard-print slip dress. Her black sneakers, on the other hand, were a kid-friendly alternative to Dr. Martens.

Former employees of these companies are at a complete loss.  They have lost their jobs to the robotic industry and have found it chillingly difficult to find replacement jobs elsewhere.  Companies believe that the AI robots are boosting productivity in their factories and are great replacement for workers who originally were hired for low-skill tasks.  PwC says this is just the start of the incorporation of AI in society.  Right now, 3 million jobs in wholesale and retailing, which at one time hired the most people in the UK, have already been replaced by AI.

There are reports that Taylor Swiftis trying to rekindle her relationship with ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal. OK! Magazine is reporting that the \"Wildest Dreams\" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.  The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, \"Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn\\'t ready for a serious relationship, but now she\\'s showing Jake how much she\\'s matured. She\\'s excited to see where things go.\"  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, \"He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor\\'s new number. They\\'ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.\"  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song \"We Are Never Getting Back Together\" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex\\'s friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  \"This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex\\'s and starts talking about how he\\'s heard we\\'re going to get back together.

Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don\\'t see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was \"no truth\" to the report.

To celebrate the monumental anniversary, three of the group\\'s members\u2014Mel B (Scary Spice), Geri Horner (Ginger Spice), and Emma Bunton (Baby Spice)\u2014all climbed into bed together to record a special thank you video for the fans. Casually mentioning a \"special party\" that the fans \"are all invited\" to, the members also slyly hinted at an upcoming reunion.  Later, the members announced that they would be touring the following year, with a special concert slotted for London\\'s historic Hyde Park. Though Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice) and Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice) have both assured the public that they had no plans to join the other three in the reunion, it seemed like the trio (which rebranded as GEM) was still determined to power forward.  Unfortunately, a pregnancy for Geri put the reunion plans on an indefinite hiatus \u2014 but even after the singer gave birth to her child in January, there was still no word on when the group would get the ball rolling again. Now, according to a report in Page Six, we have official confirmation that the reunion is back in the works thanks to Mel B\\'s impending divorce from her soon-to-be ex-husband Stephen Belafonte. According to the report, Belafonte\\'s \"controlling influence\" had always been an \"unnerving presence\" for the group.

It looks like a case of siblings\\' war. Two of the most popular siblings\\' duo \u2013 Kendall, Kylie and Bella, Gigi \u2013 are reported to be on the verge of a nasty feud.  The shocking claim comes days after Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner were spotted attending Cannes and vacationing together. But what went wrong? It appears that the Jenner mother, Kris Jenner, is to be blamed for the spiteful dispute.  According to a report by Star, the Jenner sisters and Hadid sisters are at war and Kris Jenner is fuelling the surprising conflict. Apparently, mom-manager has designed a plan to make her daughters, Kendall and Kylie, the next \"it\" girls of the fashion industry by replacing the Hadid siblings.  A source told the gossip website that Kris is \"setting the stage\" for a nasty fight between the young models. The outlet also claims, \"[Kris] is hell-bent on getting a contract for either Kendall or Kylie with Tommy [Hilfiger], like Gigi currently has.\"  Adding to the speculation, the source explained, \"The bottom line is the Hadid girls have that \\'it\\' factor, but try telling Kris. She will stop at nothing to make sure her children succeed. She\\'s determined to have her daughters in the top spot.\"  The claims sound dubious considering the fact that all the four stars are successful in their respective ways and have been closest of friends. This led to Gossip Cop reaching out to their sources to find out if the claims are true. As it turns out, the Star\\'s claims are not true.  Gossip Cop writes, \"Kendall and Kylie are not at \"war\" with Gigi and Bella, nor is the matriarch plotting to have her daughters overtake the Hadids in the fashion world. What\\'s more, the four stars are actually the best of friends, and any claims made otherwise are completely unfounded. They\\'re not in competition with each other, but extremely supportive of one another. There is no feud between the sister pairs, but just the opposite.\"  It comes as no surprise that this claim was false considering the bond Kendall, Kylie, Bella and Gigi share.  Bella and Kendall, accompanied by Kylie, were recently seen at the New York Fashion Week together where Kendall turned photographer for Bella and took a beautiful picture of the Victoria\\'s Secret model.

Wedding rumors for Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are heating up, and now many fans want to know if either party plans to protect their assets before tying the knot. Miley just happens to be worth about ten times as much as her Aussie beau and because of that, there are reports that she really wants Liam to sign a prenup before they walk down the aisle. Life & Style has reported that Miley\\'s money demands have caused stress in her relationship with Liam, and that the couple is currently fighting about whether or not a prenup is even necessary.  Miley Cyrus is worth a whopping $160 million while Liam boasts just $16 million himself. Life & Style claims that Miley wants to set up a prenup to cover their combined $176 million as they head toward marriage. Apparently, it doesn\\'t matter to Miley if everything about her relationship with Liam seems perfect right now. Cyrus is a shrewd business woman and she knows things can go south very quickly, just like they did in 2013. Miley wants to make sure that her money is safe even if her renewed romance with Liam doesn\\'t stand the test of time.  \"They\\'ve had heated arguments over this,\" a source told the magazine. \"He\\'s a firm believer that prenups spoil the romance of a marriage and that if they are truly in love, it\\'s not needed. He\\'s assured Miley he isn\\'t interested in her fortune and has enough money of his own.\"  It\\'s only fair that Miley ensures that her money is protected with a prenup in the event she does marry Liam. Cyrus is already toning down her over-the-top antics in order to make Hemsworth happy. It was Miley\\'s wild ways that pushed Liam away the first time around. Now that Liam and Miley have grown closer, fans have noticed that her hair has grown much longer and Miley isn\\'t acting out nearly as much as she was in past years.  On the other hand, Liam has realized that even if she is a little weird, Miley is the woman that he loves. While Miley has toned it down some, Liam is definitely meeting her in the middle and giving the singer some freedom to still express her true self.  After reports that Miley moved in with Liam, it looks like she also bought a house of her own. Us Magazine reports that Miley just put $2.5 million down on a 4-bedroom home in Malibu. \"The plan is for Liam to stay there while they reconnect, and then move in permanently when he\\'s ready,\" a source close to Cyrus reportedly told the gossip site. It\\'s unclear why Miley bought the home since it was reported that she was living with Liam, not far away. Now, the pair own a pair of Malibu homes. Could this be their way to get to know each other again without being together 24 hours a day?  So far, neither Miley nor Liam are talking about their reconciliation. Then again, they aren\\'t hiding their love either. Ever since Miley was spotted in Australia during the New Year\\'s holiday, she and Liam have been seen spending time together. There have even been reports that mutual friend Kellan Lutz congratulated the pair and headlines about Liam purchasing a new ring for Miley. Not to mention that Cyrus was seen sporting her old engagement ring in a few pictures on Instagram already.  Will the prenup continue to be an issue for Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth? Fans hope not and many are excited that Miley has her man back. Let\\'s just hope this new Miley is still fun and outrageous, and that Liam doesn\\'t tame the entertainer so much that it hurts her career, if they can even squash the prenup issue and make it to the altar anyway.

We can\\'t imagine Kanye West, 38, not being the bio dad for precious daughter North, two, but according to a new report, he\\'s not real her father, so who is? Kim Kardashian, 35, has had several famous exes she could have turned to when she wanted to have a child, and since she froze her eggs,\\xa0she may have asked one of them to become a baby daddy.\\xa0Let\\'s take a look at who the candidates could be!  According to a cover story in Star magazine, Kim froze her eggs in 2012 when she was worried about her ticking biological clock, and had an ex fertilize one before she got with Kanye. \"There\\'d been buzz that Kim had frozen some embryos, which she\\'d created with an ex-boyfriend\\'s sperm, so she could have a baby when she was ready.\"  So who could the daddy be? We know Kim always deeply loved Reggie Bush, 31, as they dated on and off for three years, from 2007 \u2013 2010. And he sure is handsome and would make beautiful babies! North\\'s daddy definitely is a man of color so the NFL star could be a candidate.  Her most recent ex would have been Kris Humphries, 31, who Kim was infamously married to for 72 days in 2011. While their union ended on bitter terms, could she have still turned to him to help father a baby? After all, they still weren\\'t divorced when Kim became pregnant shortly after she started dating Kanye. And what about her sex tape partner Ray J, 35? Could Kim have asked him for a daddy favor?  Stream music, completely unlimited and ad-free, RIGHT HERE  Star\\'s report claims\\xa0that Kanye wasn\\'t as eager about having kids as Kim was.\\xa0\"When Kanye refused to back down, Kim may have had one of the embryos implanted,\" their source said. \"She didn\\'t have time to wait for Kanye,\" the magazine claims.  \"People are speculating that Kim tricked Kanye into believing they conceived in Italy so he wouldn\\'t figure out the real story, that she\\'d already been implanted with an embryo that had another man\\'s DNA!\" according to their story.  While neither Kim or Kanye has commented yet, this story is pretty unbelievable. North looks like an absolutely perfect genetic combination of Kim and Kanye that simply cannot be denied!

Yikes, Tom Hiddleston and Taylor Swift\\'s romance (showmance?) really isn\\'t having the effect that their PR teams had hoped for, with Tom reportedly losing a huge contract due to the \"embarrassing\" display.  Last month it was reported that fashion giant Armani was\\xa0considering using Tom as its\\xa0new face, replacing Taylor\\'s ex, Calvin Harris. (Interesting!)  However, it seems the Italian label has gone lukewarm on the idea due to Hiddleston\\'s recent publicity-hungry antics with his new girlfriend.  Executives apparently fear that they will be seen as \"cashing in\" on the drama, something that they are eager to completely disassociate themselves from.  A source shared: \"Tom was on the shortlist as they examined who could take over from Calvin.\"  \"Obviously with Tom now being Taylor\\'s other half and the Calvin past deal, it would generate huge media coverage and headlines.  \"But Armani see themselves as classier than that and think that a rising sports star may suit their current needs better. Armani would hate to be seen as getting PR for their brand by riding on Taylor Swift\\'s coattails, so Tom will not get the job.\"  The insider continued: \"While Tom is without doubt one of the sexiest actors of his generation, he may not be the right fit this time.  \"The brand is looking at attracting 30-somethings and under, so Tom may be a little too old.\" Ouch.  Tom hit the headlines when he was conveniently photographed embracing Taylor on an isolated beach less than three weeks after she had split from her long-term boyfriend, Calvin.  The pair has embarked on a eyebrow-raising display of love across the globe, with Taylor even meeting Tom\\'s mother in front of the waiting photographers after just nine days of dating.  Tom was relentlessly mocked after donning an \"I [heart] Taylor Swift\" tank top during Fourth of July celebrations and wondered if that might have a negative impact on his career (while others wondered if it was just a joke).  If Armani is indeed shying away from the star, that negative impact might be painfully real.

Now it\\'s costing taxpayers millions! The bitter marriage betweenandcontinues to falls apart in the wake of the president\\'s womanizing. Now it\\'s costing taxpayers millions! The National ENQUIRER has seen exclusive records obtained by the government watchdogs of Judicial Watch - revealing that the feuding couple took separate private planes to take off to Hawaii for Christmas vacation!  According to official\\xa0Air Force records, the battling Obamas used both Air Force One and a Boeing C-32A - the military equivalent of a Boeing 757. The second plane was apparently used to transport the First Lady so that she didn\\'t have to travel with her Presidential spouse!  That helped to boost the costs of the strained couple\\'s Christmas vacation to a total of $3,590,313.60! Michelle was traveling\\xa0in style, too!  The Air Force\\'s fact sheet revealed that the luxury plane features \"a fully-enclosed stateroom,\" plus \"a changing area, private lavatory, separate entertainment system, two first-class swivel seats and a convertible divan that seats three and folds out to a bed.\"  The ENQUIRER has already revealed how the angry First Lady has earned the nickname \"Monster Michelle\" from staffers who watch in fear as she often goes on the warpath!  \"Michelle has been labeled a \\'ruthless mon\\xadster\\' for bullying not only Barack, but her loyal staff,\" said an insider. \"She dishes out abuse and punish\\xadment for the slightest of infractions. She doesn\\'t give a damn who she humiliates - even the presi\\xaddent!\"  Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg\\xa0(pictured) crashed her family\\'s Martha\\'s Vineyard vacation The ENQUIRER exposed how Michelle Obama exploded in fury when(pictured) crashed her family\\'s Martha\\'s Vineyard vacation and made off with her husband! Sources said that Caroline - President Barack Obama\\'s U.S. ambassador to Japan - showed up out of the blue during the last week of the Obamas\\' two-week vacation on the Massachusetts island.  \"He immediately started flirting up a storm, while Michelle could barely keep her temper in check,\" a snitch told The ENQUIRER. \"Even though both their families were there, it was really intense!\"  The ENQUIRER has also caught the First Couple fighting over wild child Malia after the 17-year-old was recently caught at a boozy Brown University student bash. Eyewitnesses said the First Daughter was playing the popular campus drinking game called\\xa0Beer Pong!  \"The First Lady and the President got into a screaming match over it, each blaming the other for letting their underage daughter attend a wild drinking party,\" said a political insider.  Michelle also ignored the taxpayers when she stormed off for a trip to China with her mother and daughters - putting aside Obama\\'s concerns over cost.  Insiders told The ENQUIRER that Michelle (seen here in France)\\xa0couldn\\'t stand to be around her husband after the president took an embarrassing \"selfie\" photo with sexy Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt at Nelson Mandela\\'s memorial service!

Not everyone is a fan of\\xa0Kim Kardashian and/or the books she pretends to write.  Just the other day, some 74-year old got arrested after vandalizing six copies of Kim\\'s selfie-based memoir.  But we have a pretty strong feeling the only damage anyone will do to the tome discussed will be to spray one\\'s sticky seed all over its page.  If you know what we mean.  According to one of the funniest Radar Online stories we\\'ve read in awhile, Kardashian is considering the release of a nude cookbook.  Yes, a nude cookbook. As in, a cookbook that features family recipes AND photos of Kim Kardashian nude.  We challenge anyone out there to come up with a better idea that a book that will enable readers to feed both their actual appetite and their sexual appetite at the same time.  A video report on Radar claims that \"Kim Kardashian has found a new way to line her pockets, even when she doesn\\'t have any,\" adding by way of explanation:  \"The reality tart is pitching publishers on the idea of a cookbook in which she poses nude next to her favorite recipes.\"  This may seem like a far-fetched concept, but ask yourself two things:  You don\\'t need to tell us the answer to question number-one. We understand if you\\'re a bit embarrassed to admit it.  But the answer to question number-two is revealed below:  Before you dismiss this idea as pure nonsense, allow us to direct your attention to David Thorpe\\'s \"Rude Food.\"  In that cookbook, the late photographer conjures images with subtle juxtapositions of attractive and tastefully nude models, along with an astonishing variety of foodstuffs.  Via Amazon, this allowed him \"to create the ultimate in humerous and safe innuendo.\"  An anonymous insider tells Radar that\\xa0Kardashian is convinced \"her concept will succeed because she thinks she\\'s in the best shape of her life after having two children.\"  She does look pretty good at the moment, don\\'t you think?  Last week, The National Enquirer also alleged that Kim was considering a naked cookbook, writing that the wife of Kanye West wanted to show the world her \"generous cupcakes.\"  By this, we assume the publication meant her \"very large breasts.\"  For someone who has been out of the spotlight for months, ever since that scary armed robbery in Paris in early October, this would certainly be a way for Kardashian to get the world talking about her once again.  She could make the talk show rounds.  She could gain new social media followers.  She could recapture all the attention lost to sister Kylie Jenner.  We really don\\'t see any drawbacks.  Moreover, come on... would this really be the most ridiculous idea for a book from a member of the Kardashian-Jenner family?  Considering the following releases, all of which are 100% real, it may actually be the best. ',\n 'Lindsay Lohan Doing Drugs on Oprah\\'s Dime!

The media mogul denies shelling out big bucks on an apartment for the actress, but insiders say the posh pad is for real - and LiLo is taking advantage of it! \"Lindsay was 100 percent doing lines of cocaine at the apartment Oprah got her,\" a source tells Star. \"She was doing it out in the open, in front of three friends.\"  This isn\\'t the first drug binge for the 27-year-old that Star\\xa0has uncovered, either.

The smiling reaction from the duo suggested the Golden Globe nominee was tears of happiness.  MailOnline has contacted a representative for Kirsten Dunst for comment.  In spite of it being an emotional night, Kirsten looked beautiful in a full-length prom queen-style gown.  The Virgin Suicides starlet pinned her golden locks back, letting only a few wisps fall forward to frame her face.  But Kirsten's stunning appearance was not marred by her tears as her slick of scarlet lipstick and eyeliner remained perfectly in place.  Touched by the night's emotions, she clasped her hand to her chest as she appeared to confide in her co-star Colin Farrell.  The actress did not publicly share the reason to why she suddenly burst into tears.  Later she was seen laughing and smiling with pals after an unexpectedly eventful red carpet appearance.  Kirsten was promoting her movie, The Beguiled, which tells the story of an injured solider who seeks shelter in an all girls' boarding school.  As the drama unfolds and the serviceman (Colin Farrell) tries to win the hearts of the women who nurse him.  Dangerous rivalries begin to form between the women (played by Kirsten, Elle Fanning and Nicole Kidman) as a result of sexual temptation.  During filming for a previous movie, the director had asked Kirsten to lose weight but she had refused.  Recalling the incident, she told Variety: 'I\u2019m eating fried chicken and McDonald\u2019s before work. So I\u2019m like, 'We have no options!

The young woman is busy mixing up a prestigious internship at the Weinstein & Co. offices in Manhattan and cool nights with friends on the town.

She was also spotted having a fun time with a young man who was later identified as Rob Franklin.  Those headlines raised a lot of questions in some circles, and the power couple is reportedly not immune to the intense chatter.  Is she mature enough to handle life in this big place? Should they be more present in the life of the teenager at this crucial juncture?

But Ryan Gosling seems to have found the best way to quit smoking once and for all, and according to him, it actually works.  The 35-year-old actor told Australian radio hosts,\\xa0Kyle And Jackie O,\\xa0on Tuesday that he 'smoked himself out' whilst filming The Nice Guys, in which he plays a private investigator Holland March, who is addicted to cigarettes.  Admitting he was a smoker in real life before filming, the father-of-two revealed he has since quit after being turned off by smoking too much.  'I use to, but in this movie I smoked myself out,' he laughed, adding: 'I never want another cigarette again!'  'It really is the greatest way to quit - it's hard to come by - you really have to get a film where you have to smoke all the time, but I highly recommend it if you are trying to quit,' he went on.  As well as smoking a lot for the film, the Hollywood star also revealed he drank a lot too - largely due to the influence of his co-star Russell Crowe.  'In\\xa0terms of the drinking, I am supposed to be drunk all the time in the film, but it actually worked out because I went out with Russell right before we started shooting, so I was still drunk the entire shoot,' he said.  He went on to add: 'So I never had to play drunk once, I was 'Scooby Doo-py' all day long thanks to him!' he joked.  During the chat, Ryan spoke of the close friendship he formed with the Australian star during filming, and says Russell introduced him to some iconic Aussie traits.  'God bless him he tried to teach me about Rugby,' the actor said.  'He was also pumping me with these Australian ginger beer and vodka while he was trying to teach me,' he added.  Kyle was quick to interject, saying: 'That's not very Australian! I don't think I know anyone who drinks that!'  However, Ryan wasn't having any of it, responding: 'Hey listen to me... If Rusty says it's Australian, it's Australian! You understand?'  The two stars are currently on the promotional trail for The Nice Guys.  Russell plays a contract killer to Ryan's private investigator in the film, with the pair working together to solve the mysterious disappearance of a porn star in 1970s Los Angeles.

However, a new report claims otherwise. The new report says that it is impossible for Prince George\\'s mom to have miscarried her second baby when she is not keen on getting pregnant anymore and would rather adopt instead. In fact, this is one of the things that Kate and Queen Elizabeth are arguing heatedly about.  The Aug. 11th print edition of Life & Style Magazine claims that Kate Middleton and Queen Elizabeth are in a serious row. This is not because Kate Middleton lost what could have been the baby sister (reportedly!) of Prince George, but because she does not want to get pregnant again at all. The assumption is that Camilla Parker-Bowles, Prince Charles\\' wife is the only royalty getting on the nerves of Queen Elizabeth, but it seems as if Kate Middleton is rubbing the Queen the wrong way too.  Celeb Dirty Laundry reports that Kate Middleton had it with all the meddling the Queen is doing with her personal affairs, especially on how to raise Prince George and when she should get pregnant again. Even though she originally wanted a lot of kids, having a difficult pregnancy with her first child made her apprehensive and scared about having another baby. Even though she\\'s not entirely closing her doors to another baby, Kate is said to not want to have a second baby just yet.\\xa0 Allegedly, she would rather adopt than have another one!  Because what the Queen wants, the Queen should get, Kate\\'s attitude is making the Queen see red. \\xa0The idea that an adopted baby will grow up to become royalty is enough to send the Queen to a frenzy. \\xa0Royal tradition would say that only a baby with the royal family\\'s bloodline would be considered \"a spare\" for the throne, so what Kate is suggesting will blow that tradition off. Kate knows this but she also observes that the Queen has not been that inflexible with other things to accommodate the needs of a modern monarchy. She is hoping against hope that the Queen might budge on this one so she does not undergo another difficult pregnancy and she would get to raise a child that is desperate for a good home, Celeb Dirty Laundry reports.  This is not the first time that Kate Middleton\\'s ways and ideas crossed the Queen. The Life & Style magazine\\'s July 14 feature \"Tormented by the Queen,\" said the Queen flew into rage when she learned of Middleton\\'s plans to move baby Prince George out of London.  Kate Middleton just wants to spend more time enjoying Prince George rather than plan another baby though. For this summer, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would change their yearly summer plan of vacationing in the private island of Mystique. With Prince George now in tow, August will be spent a bit differently.  \"The couple will spend the rest of the time off in Norfolk, where the final refurbishments\\xa0are being completed at their new country home, Anmer Hall, on the Queen\\'s Sandringham Estate,\"\\xa0shared\\xa0royal family sources with Vanity Fair.

Going by her married name, Stella Stolper, the tough-talking Russian native competed on Season 4 of \u201cLast Comic Standing\u201d while pregnant with her second child.  In a clip from an episode that aired June 20, 2006, she jokes about her pregnancy, telling the crowd, \u201cI love the babies! I want to have more kids, really, I do! I just can\u2019t take the pain, and the nausea and all that weight. And I\u2019m not talking about the nine months of being pregnant, I\u2019m talking about the two minutes the old man\u2019s on top of me.\u201d  Why Mariah Carey's manager is more like a 'dictator' Unfortunately for Bulochnikov, the audience couldn\u2019t take her jokes: She was voted off in the same episode.  Her efforts at comedy stardom may lend credence to rumors that Bulochnikov, an experienced TV producer and the mastermind behind \u201cMariah\u2019s World,\u201d is eager for her own fame.  \u201cStella is the one who really wants to be the reality star. She even filmed a pilot for herself last year,\u201d an insider who used to work with the self-proclaimed \u201cRussian dictator\u201d previously told Page Six. \u201cThis will likely be more of a TV launching vehicle for her. It\u2019s going to be like the Stella show, which is what she\u2019s always wanted. She is definitely very much out for herself, and this is a golden opportunity for her because she wants to be famous. She wants to be the one in the magazines.\u201d  The source added, \u201cStella is the furthest thing from a manager. She\u2019s a TV producer. She\u2019s practically moved in with Mariah and now she has so much stuff on her that she can get her to do anything. She\u2019s pulling the strings, and Mariah does whatever she says.\u201d \",\n 'Brad Pitt Struggles To Smile At Hollywood Event While Custody Battle Wears Him Down  After a long court battle with his former wife Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt showed up with a relax and smiling aura in Malibu on Saturday night.

At that time, Megyn very closely beat Kelly and Ryan by 172,000 viewers (2.932 million vs. 2.760 million). The best part for Megyn? She outnumbered them in the prime age demo: 25 to 54.  However, after a few bad interviews (who could ever forget the Jane Fonda and Will & Grace cast mishap), Megyn\\'s ratings have gone down by 14 percent, which means Kelly and Ryan have taken the lead back.

Things have been difficult for Megyn since her NBC debut.

',\n \"Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Come Out As an Item, After 'Tom Cruise Ban' Expires  Now here\u2019s something to really jump up and down on the couch for.  Hollywood\u2019s worst-kept romantic secret\u2014the relationship between Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes\u2014is finally out of the bag, after the couple was photographed walking hand in hand on the beach in Malibu on Labor Day, wearing matching fedoras no less.  They have repeatedly denied they are in a relationship over the past few years, despite incessant rumors and frequent sightings of them together.  Indeed, on one occasion, a friend of the couple, apparently unaware of the omerta, accidentally mentioned their relationship to media outlets, only to issue a hasty retraction.  The absurd level of secrecy, and their public appearance together this week, looks set to give credence to an extraordinary rumor first reported by the gossip site RadarOnline.  In September last year,\\xa0Radar\\xa0claimed that as part of her divorce settlement from Top Gun star Cruise, Holmes had agreed not to publicly date anyone until five years had passed following the end of her marriage.  \u201cKatie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him or Scientology, or publicly dating another man for\\xa0five years after the divorce,\u201d the source claimed.  \u201cShe\u2019s allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she\u2019s not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, Suri,\u201d the insider told Radar. \u201cKatie wanted out of the marriage so badly, she agreed to the terms\u2014and got $4.8 million in child support, plus another $5 million for herself.\u201d  Cruise and Holmes agreed to a divorce settlement in just 10 days, with the pact reportedly stipulating Suri would not have any contact with Cruise\u2019s religion, Scientology.  However, had Holmes broken the rules about \u201cembarrassing\u201d Cruise, she could have lost the money, the source alleged.  If true, that five-year period would have ended in June\u2014which may explain why the couple has now come out.  Remarkably, most observers believe Foxx and Holmes have been together since 2013\u2014about a year after her split from\\xa0Tom Cruise\u2014when they were photographed dancing together at a charity bash in The Hamptons.  But they have largely avoided being photographed together and consistently denied they are a couple since then.  There have been a few slips; for example, Katie was seen with a\\xa0ring on her finger\\xa0in March 2016, but Foxx\u2019s rep said it wasn\u2019t from him.  It was claimed the two met at each other\u2019s homes and that Katie sometimes disguised herself with wigs and hats to meet up with Foxx without being noticed.  In March 2015, a photo surfaced showing the two stars sitting in a recording studio holding hands.  Jamie is seen reclining in his chair, holding Katie\u2019s hand and gazing at her, with his legs subtly intertwining hers. The actress sat with her legs crossed and staring at her phone, with her foot is resting on one of Jamie\u2019s, while his other foot sneaks around her calf.  Foxx denied reports of romance, insisting the two were \u201cjust friends.\u201d  In December 2015, Holmes was a guest at Jamie\u2019s surprise birthday party in New York at La Bilboquet restaurant.  And soon after, she was spotted at The Honor Bar in Beverly Hills with the actor\u2019s youngest daughter, Annalise.  In June 2016, there seemed to be the first public confirmation that Foxx and Holmes were, indeed, in a relationship when\\xa0former Real Housewives of Atlanta star Claudia Jordan, a friend, said they were dating.  \u201cHe is very happy with her. I like that he seems very happy,\u201d Claudia said during an interview for the Allegedly podcast.  However, Jordan quickly retracted, telling Entertainment Tonight the day after the podcast reveal that she had \u201cno knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019ve never seen them together. He\u2019s never told me he\u2019s dating her,\u201d she said.  In April this year, a restaurant customer snapped a photo of them having dinner in New York, and in May they were spotted separately boarding the same private jet at Le Bourget Airport in Paris. They were photographed leaving the Park Hyatt Vendome hotel separately.  To make it impossible to get photo evidence that they are together, they traveled \u201cin cars with tinted windows and took secret back elevators,\u201d Us Weekly\\xa0reported in April.  The couple is said to be exhausted by the need for secrecy, and is doubtless thrilled that the long and allegedly controlling shadow of Tom Cruise will no longer be a presence in their lives. \",\n 'Kevin Hart Begs Wife Eniko Parrish For Forgiveness With $250000 Push Gift  Kevin Hart is telling himself \u2014 nothing says \u201cI am sorry for cheating and humiliating you\u201d like a $250,000 gift.  If the latest rumors are accurate, Hart feels bad for his pregnant wife, Eniko Parrish, after getting caught in a sex scandal with stripper and singer Montia Sabbag and is, therefore, willing to spend a small fortune on a lavish baby shower and a push present.  A friend of the comedian told a popular publication that he is going to shower the woman carrying his baby with diamonds to show how committed he is to their marriage.  The person told the media outlet: \u201cKevin [Hart] is planning the ultimate push present to give to his wife, Eniko [Parrish]. He has not picked it out yet, but he has decided that it is going to be very expensive and have lots of diamonds. He wants this present to be a symbol of his love and commitment to Eniko and their new baby. Kevin asked his assistant to help pick out a super bling ring, necklace, or something classy out for Eniko in the $250k price range. Kevin is determined to prove to Eniko that he loves her and wants their relationship to last.\u201d  Another insider claimed that Hart has nothing to worry about because while his wife is hurt, she is deep in the third trimester, and has no plans to raise a baby alone.  The source explained: \u201cEniko is hurt and angry, but she is nowhere near ready to walk away. She simply can\u2018t imagine her life without Kevin. He is her world, and it has been that way since she was 23 years old. Throwing it all away over one mistake is just not something she can do right now.\u201d  The pal shared that Parrish is focused living a stress-free life and having a healthy baby.  The friend revealed: \u201cLeaving him is not even a question, she is in her third trimester and already thinking like a mamma bear. Her child\u2019s needs come first. And right now Eniko knows she needs to stay as calm and centered as possible. Breaking up with Kevin right now is only going to put more stress on her.\u201d  Some commenters say that Hart should be honest with himself and start an open marriage if that is not already the case.

But, is ex mentioned him in TWO tracks! Here\u2019s what he thinks \u2026   Tom Hiddleston, 36, was shocked to learn that Taylor Swift, 27, dropped some bars about their relationship on her new album, \u201cReputation\u201c. But, come on, Tom; anyone\u2019s fair game in Tay land. The singer referenced her ex on two tracks \u2014 \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d and \u201cGetaway Car\u201d. And, since the pair didn\u2019t split on bad terms [or so we thought], he was under the impression that he would\u2019ve gotten a get out of fail free card when it was time for Tay to pen a new album.  \u201cTom was not expecting to be a part of Taylor\u2019s album,\u201d a source close to the actor tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cHe thought they were on good terms,\u201d our insider says, adding, \u201cAfter their break-up, he was always asked if he was worried she was going to write about him, and he always said no. But everyone\u2019s saying she did and he\u2019s stunned. He genuinely thought he was going to get spared.\u201d Well, maybe next time, Tom.  As soon as Taylor\u2019s sixth studio album dropped, at midnight on Nov. 10, fans instantly began dissecting each and every lyric, as did we! And, here\u2019s what we came up with. The first Tom reference came on her track, \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d, which is actually about two men who made a mark on her 2016 year. The first verse is a nod to Kanye West, 40, where she sings about a \u201cnarcissist\u201d who \u201ctalks sh-t.\u201d Then, Tom came in. In the second verse, Tay sings about a \u201cplayboy\u201d who she flew \u201caround the world\u201d with before she broke up with him. Well, she and Tom flew to Italy in the beginning stages of their relationship. Then, the song references to this man spending all of her money. And, when Tay and Tom were together, it was speculated that he was with her for her fame. So, you can decide.  The second Tom reference on \u201cReputation\u201d came on the track, \u201cGetaway Car\u201d, which happens to be the only breakup song on the album. This track references both Tom and Calvin Harris, 33. In the beginning of the song, Taylor sings about wanting to get out of one relationship, but she doesn\u2019t have a \u201creason.\u201d Then, when she goes to an event where \u201cthe ties were black and the lights were white,\u201d she found her reason \u2014 a new man, aka, Tom. In case you forgot, Taylor and Tom were first linked when they were seen together at the Met Gala\u2026 the home of black ties. Not long after the Met, she split with Calvin and ended up dating Tom. Coincidence? Nah. THEN, when the chorus comes around, Tay points out that the new relationship didn\u2019t work out, and that the person [Tom] should\u2019ve known how things would end, because of how they got together in the first place. And, again, you can decide. For a complete guide to every song and its hidden meaning, check out our full breakdown here.  Taylor and Tom were first linked at the Met Gala in 2016, as mentioned above. They even attended a pre-Met dinner at the home of Vogue\u2018s editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, 68. Exactly one month later, she and Calvin split; and, two weeks after that, she and Tom were photographed in Rhode Island together. And, the rest was history, until they split just three months later in Sept. 2016.   HollywoodLifers, tell us, do you love Taylor\u2019s new album?

Marriage No. 4 Just 8 Months After Split With Brad.\u201d The tabloid was running with the idea that Angelina Jolie\u2019s divorce from Brad was being fast-tracked in order to allow a new marriage to a \u201cwealthy, 40-something Brit.\u201d Angelina\u2019s dating of this \u201cphilanthropist business man\u201d was supposedly being \u201cshielded\u201d from the public \u201cby her closest friends.\u201d Worse, Angelina\u2019s children were supposedly out of the loop and had not yet met their new future father figure despite a wedding being planned.  \u201cA quickie wedding would be the ultimate payback [to Brad Pitt],\u201d claimed an unnamed \u201cfamily friend\u201d who is the supposed source for In Touch.  While Angelina does have a history of quickly remarrying after her previous divorces, in this case, there are Angelina and Brad\u2019s six kids to consider, making a quick divorce and new marriage very unlikely. In April, Gossip Cop pointed out that \u201cthis tabloid has a proven history of making assumptions and trying to mislead its readers\u201d and an unnamed source of their own claimed that Angie\u2019s 2017 wedding rumors are \u201cbeyond ridiculous.\u201d  In A Related Report By The Inquisitr  Angelina Jolie\u2019s Children Will Soon Be Living Just Minutes Away From Brad Pitt In Los Feliz, Photo Reveals  Is Brad Pitt Dating? Angelina Jolie Will Reportedly Be Unhappy If He Is  Angelina Jolie\u2019s Kids Are Her Priority, Is She Ready to Co-Parent With Brad Pitt?  Angelina Jolie Relying On Kids To Cheer Her Up After Brad Pitt Split \u2014 Divorce Details Revealed  Fast forward in time and In Touch has been doubling down, riding the celebrity rumors train full steam ahead. Now, they are running a cover allegedly showing Angelina Jolie\u2019s wedding in Cambodia. The front cover and the way it features Angelina\u2019s wedding dress are designed to give the impression that Angie has already been married. But if you break open the tabloid, In Touch is claiming Angelina is still planning a future 2017 wedding in Battambang, Cambodia.  The latest edition is still alleging that Jolie has \u201cquietly fallen for a wealthy 40-something British philanthropist and businessman, and she\u2019s eager to marry for the fourth time as soon as her divorce from Brad is finalized.\u201d The same \u201cfamily friend\u201d is supposedly spilling the beans on the movie star\u2019s plans for a small wedding that celebrates the Cambodian culture. Pitt is supposedly not \u201cstanding in her way anymore.\u201d The funny part is that no one knows the name of Angelina\u2019s dating partner, his age, or any other major life detail.  In this case, Gossip Cop claims the \u201ctabloid is stepping in it further and further, as the only thing that stinks around here is the magazine\u2019s dreadful reporting.\u201d The real problem is that it\u2019s not merely bad information from an unknown source, Gossip Cop alleges that In Touch \u201chas simply been making it all up\u201d by generating fake news.  What is the truth? After all, there have been secret celebrity marriage ceremonies in the past, including well-known names like Jennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux, Ryan Gosling, and Eva Mendes. In the end, In Touch and its secret \u201cfamily friend\u201d stand alone in reporting Angelina Jolie\u2019s wedding plans, while Gossip Cop has a source claiming that the tabloid has \u201ccreated a soap opera-worthy, but false, narrative.\u201d It seems safe to say this celebrity news is debunked.

She is the biggest star in the world.\" And it was time to remind her fans.  The first attempt came right after Beyonce announced the news. Kardashian took to her Twitter to share with her fans that she had finally updated her app, Kim Kardashian Hollywood!  \"Had to change up my look in #KimKardashianGame! Have you guys seen the latest update? @KKHOfficial,\" Kardashian wrote on Twitter.  Seeing that had not done anything to put a dent in Beyonce\\'s big news, the KUWTK wife of Yeezy rapper, Kanye West, tried yet again \u2013 by announcing that she and pal, Chrissy Tiegen, were starting their own book club.  \"So guys..... @chrissyteigen & @jenatkinhair & I are starting a book club!,\" Kardashian posted. Sadly, no massive celebrations erupted like she was hoping.  But that\\'s not all! Earlier in the day, Kardashian misled fans to believe that she and West, 39, were ALSO expecting another child together. When a fan asked it it were true, however, Kardashian quickly shot it down.  \"While everyone was tweeting and sending congratulations to Beyonce and Jay Z, Kim and Kanye did not say one word about it on their social media,\" the source told Radar.  \"The fact that Beyonce is going to have more kids than Kim once her twins are born absolutely drives Kim nuts!\"  \"Kim was totally trying to steal Beyonce\\'s baby thunder yesterday.\"  As Radar reported, Kardashian and West \u2013 like Beyonce and Jay Z \u2013 hit several rough patches in their superstar union this year, leading many to believe that the two were headed for a messy divorce.  But it seems that one sure-fire way to get over a slump is by getting another baby bump!  \"Kim is going to try harder than ever right now to get pregnant because she is constantly searching for a way to one up Beyonce,\" the insider claimed. \"She seems so jealous that Beyonce is more famous than she is. It doesn\\'t seem like Kim will ever, be okay with that.\"  Do you think that Kim Kardashian should get pregnant so that she can have as many children as Beyonce has? Tell us your thoughts below.

',\n 'Former Beatle Ringo Starr Claims the \"Real\" Paul McCartney Died in 1966 and Was Replaced by Look-Alike  Beverly Hills| The former drummer of the Beatles, Ringo Starr, surprised the world this morning during an interview in his luxurious Californian residence, when he admitted that the 45-year old rumors about the alleged death of Paul McCartney in 1966 were actually true.  In an exclusive interview with the Hollywood Inquirer, Mr. Starr explained that the \"real\" Paul McCartney had died in a car crash on November 9 1966, after an argument during a Beatles\\' recording session. To spare the public from grief, the Beatles replaced him with a man named William Shears Campbell, who was\\xa0the winner of a McCartney look-alike contest and who happened to have the same kind of jovial personality as Paul.  \"When Paul died, we\\xa0all\\xa0panicked!\" claims Ringo, obviously very emotional. \"We didn\\'t know what to do, and Brian Epstein, our manager, suggested that we hire Billy Shears as a temporary solution. It was supposed to last only a week or two, but time went by and\\xa0nobody seemed to notice, so we kept playing along. Billy turned out to be a pretty good musician and he was able to perform almost better than Paul. The only problem was that he couldn\\'t get along with John, at all.\"  William Shears Campbell, better known as Billy Shears, does indeed \"disappear \" from records\\xa0in 1966 and no\\xa0traces of him can be found after Paul\\'s alleged death.  Mr. Starr alleges that the group did send out a lot of hidden messages through the years to prepare the population for the truth.  He notably says that the entire Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band album was awash with Paul-is-dead clues: the Beatles had indeed officially\\xa0formed a \"new\" band featuring a \"fictional\" member named Billy Shears, which happened to be the actual name of Paul\\'s replacement.  \"We felt guilty about the deception\" added Ringo Starr. \"We wanted to tell the world the truth, but we were afraid of the reactions it would provoke. We thought the whole planet was going to hate us for all the lies we had told, so we kept lying but sending subtle clues to relieve our cousciousness. When the first rumors finally began about the whole thing, we felt very nervous and started fighting a lot with each other. At some point, it was too much for John and he decided to leave the band.\"  Ringo Starr claims that he finally decided to tell the truth, because he was afraid that it was going to die with him. At age 74, he is the only other\\xa0surviving member of the famous band besides Paul McCartney, and he was afraid the deception would never be revealed.  The rumors of Paul\\'s death began more than 45 years ago, but had always been dismissed as nonsense by the band and its entourage. In September 1969, American college students published a series of articles in which they claimed that clues to McCartney\\'s death could be found among the lyrics and artwork of the Beatles\\' recordings. Clue-hunting rapidly\\xa0proved infectious, and within a few weeks, it\\xa0had become an international phenomenon. Rumours only declined after a contemporary interview with McCartney was published in Life magazine in November 1969.  Neither Paul McCartney nor anyone from his entourage have commented Ringo Starr\\'s declaration yet, but the interview has already provoked a lot of reactions around the world. Journalists and paparazzis from around the world have surrounded the residence of the musician only minutes after the interview was broadcasted and are awaiting for the star to comment the allegations.  The British MI5 also announced an investigation to determine if an impostor could have indeed posed for 48 years as\\xa0the\\xa0Member of the Order of the British Empire,\\xa0Sir James\\xa0Paul McCartney,\\xa0during official ceremonies involving\\xa0Queen Elizabeth II.

According to a new report from Star, Kim is treating her prenup to Kanye like a business transaction, which is probably a smart decision. Let\\'s be realistic \u2013 how long is this marriage going to last? Two years? Five years? She\\'s already gone through this rodeo once, and she knows that eventually, she\\'ll end up getting Kanye\\'s money if she plays her cards right. The only question is \u2013 how much?  Kanye is reportedly worth $100 million whereas Kim is only worth $40 million, and so Kim is supposedly trying to, \\'take as much of Kanye\\'s fortune as possible\\'. A source explains, \"Kim and Kris [Jenner] apparently want a $10 million cheating clause in the prenup too, in the event that the marriage ends due to the rapper\\'s wandering eye. Kris\\xa0wants Kim to get $5 million a year for each year they\\'re married, plus a $20 million bonus if they last five years.\"  Kanye\\'s so whipped that he might actually go for this, and you know that five years down the line, Kris is going to make sure Kim will cash in that $20 bonus. Like, her daughter\\'s happiness? Please, she would rather have the $20 million.  And although we\\'ve discussed Kim\\'s demands, Kanye\\'s supposed demands are even more ridiculous. Star claims that Kanye will include something called a \\'classy clause\\', which will, \"prevent Kim from doing anything to embarrass him during the marriage or the divorce proceedings.\" Well, I wouldn\\'t count on that lasting, especially since there\\'s only so long Kim will contain her inner famewhore during their marriage. ',\n \"Kristen Stewart Drops 'Twilight' Movie Plans With Robert Pattinson: Lands New Role In 'Underwater' Thriller | Celeb Dirty Laundry  It looks like Kristen Stewart won't have any time on her hands to make another 'Twilight' movie with Robert Pattinson in the near future. In fact, new reports indicate that the Hollywood star has just landed a new role in the psychological thriller, 'Underwater.'  According to Deadline, the film is about an underwater scientific crew that struggle to survive after an earthquake. Kristen will star as Noah, a woman who ends up in a relationship with another crewmember. And while there have been reports suggesting that Kristen might reunite with her ex-boyfriend Robert Pattinson for another 'Twilight' film, at this point it doesn't look like it's going to happen.  Then again, many fans believe that one of the reasons why there will never be another 'Twilight' movie made again is because Robert Pattinson doesn't want to work with Kristen Stewart again. After all, she absolutely humiliated him right before their break-up in 2012. Robert was devastated when he found out that Kristen was having a secret affair with director Rupert Sanders behind his back. His trust issues with Kristen would make it hard for the two to ever work together again.  Plus, Robert Pattinson has moved on with FKA Twigs. He doesn't want to deal with the tabloid media and even more unnecessary rumors about his personal life. Meanwhile, Kristen is dating model Stella Maxwell. The last thing Robert wants is to be involved in a messy and complicated love triangle with his ex and his current girlfriend. He wants to concentrate on his Hollywood career and not the gossip magazines that write about his love life.  But for Kristen Stewart, she doesn't feel that way. She loves the attention she gets whenever her name is in the headlines. She even mentioned earlier this month that she would be open to filming another 'Twilight' movie if the script and timing were both right. She even told reporters that she would be the first person to read it, too.  What do you think of Kristen's new role in 'Underwater?'

The Shake It Off hitmaker, who hit out at streaming services for offering her music for free in 2015, is said to have made moves to brand a website 'featuring non-downloadable multi-media content in the nature of audio recordings'.  TMZ report that the website will be dubbed 'Swifties' and will launch a line of music products complete with guitars, picks, straps and drumsticks atop organising educational trips, online courses and retreats.  Taylor's now-famous feud with streaming services saw her reveal\\xa0she will not allow her latest album on Apple Music to protest its 'shocking' lack of artist compensation during a free trial period.  The move by Taylor, who is one of the most outspoken critics of Spotify, delivered an early blow to Apple's bid to dominate the booming sector two years ago.  She said that the tech giant, which launched Apple Music in June 2015, will not pay for songs streamed during a free three-month trial period for new subscribers.  'I find it to be shocking, disappointing and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company,' she wrote in a posting on Tumblr.  Taylor - whose '1989' was the top-selling US album in 2014 and remained high on the charts - insisted that she was speaking for all artists and not just herself.  'This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt.  'This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field...but will not get paid for a quarter of a year's worth of plays on his or her songs.  'These are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much.'  'Three months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration for everything else Apple has done,' she continued.  'I hope that soon I can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right.  'But I say to Apple with all due respect, it's not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don't ask you for free iPhones. Please don't ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.'

We have learned that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is still unable to wear her jewelry.  As fans may already be aware, ever since she was robbed at gunpoint in her Paris suite last year, Kim has been battling panic attacks and anxiety that rendered her homebound for months.  When she finally returned to her public life, the Kardashian seemed a whole different person \u2013 a lot more modest and reserved than usual.  Apparently, although she looked like she was getting better, sources say anxiety and panic attacks still take place and wearing jewelry is what triggers them!  \u2018She thought she would be over this by now, but if anything it\u2019s getting worse. Kim is much stronger about most aspects of the trauma, but whenever she puts on a heavy necklace or even a favorite watch it gives her panic attacks and terrible flashbacks. She is looking fantastic and can cope with the occasional light piece of jewelry, but feels naked without being able to wear some of her favorite necklaces and earrings,\u2019 the insider said about Kim\u2019s more casual style these days.  Her trauma over the robbery that could have cost her her life has even led Kardashian to attend therapy in order to cope with the trauma.  But despite the fact that her therapist is of great help, they are still figuring out how to fix her accessories issue.  For now, the only solution is to wear as little jewelry as possible.

Kendall Jenner has found herself modeling for some of the biggest campaigns in fashion for the past two years, and as her brand continues to skyrocket, so are her annual earnings through endorsements, sponsorship deals, and modeling contracts.  Seeing how well things have been going with her career, Kendall Jenner sees no reason why she should remain on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. She\u2019s grown tired of sharing her personal life on television, and now that she\u2019s working harder than ever before, she doesn\u2019t even have the time to shoot scenes for the show anymore.  From Kendall Jenner\u2019s point of view, the 21-year-old wants to build a brand that\u2019s mainly focused on her modeling career. Sources say that by being on reality TV, Kendall thinks it could potentially hinder her chances of being taken seriously in the fashion industry.  She\u2019s worked extremely hard to distance herself from being known as nothing more than Kim Kardashian\u2019s little sister, and while it\u2019s paid off for her, for the most part, Kendall Jenner can\u2019t stress enough that she needs to leave the world of reality television to truly be taken seriously by some of the biggest fashion designers in the world.  Sharing everything about her life, including who she\u2019s dating, could potentially have an effect on the relationship she will go on to form with industry people. To eventually become as famous and successful as Naomi Campbell or Kate Moss, being on reality television is not going to cut it for her.  \u201cKendall will still make some appearances here and there in [KUWTK], and in Kylie\u2019s new show, but only when she\u2019s in town and around \u2014 she wants to limit her time on camera as much as possible,\u201d an insider tells Hollywood Life.  For now, she has limited the amount of appearance she makes on KUWTK, along with her sister\u2019s forthcoming reality show, Life of Kylie. But her overall intentions are to eventually stop making appearances entirely, saying that it\u2019s no longer where her mind is at.  \u201cKendall\u2019s modeling career is going really amazing, and she\u2019s worked so hard to be taken seriously. She feels like she\u2019s finally getting there and that she\u2019s now being booked because she\u2019s Kendall the model, not just one of the Kardashians. Kendall is grateful for the start in her career that the show gave her, it was a great springboard for her, but at the same time, it was a hiderence\u2014and it\u2019s not the thing that she wants to be known for in her life.\u201d  Last month, the E! network confirmed that Kylie Jenner had landed her own spin-off titled Life of Kylie, Variety reports, which is expected to premiere in July.  The series will follow Kylie on her journey to branching out and building an empire that\u2019s focused on beauty and cosmetics.  Kylie Cosmetics, her reputable company, is already said to make millions in profit each month, and while Kylie the businesswoman will often be seen on the show, Kendall\u2019s little sister will also touch upon personal subjects such as her breakup with Tyga.  Anything that could potentially make Kendall Jenner look bad is something that she wants to stay away from, so if there\u2019s any sort of drama or tension on Kylie\u2019s show, Kendall is sure to keep her distance because she doesn\u2019t want to be seen in that light.  Do you think it\u2019s a wise move for Kendall Jenner to ditch KUWTK in favor of building a respected modeling career with longevity?

According to Perez Hilton, Tyga is reportedly planning to release a tell-all book in the wake of his big break-up with Kylie. Insiders close to the \"Make It Nasty\" rapper have dropped a few details about the rumored upcoming book.  But how would the Keeping Up With the Kardashians matriarch, Kris Jenner, feel about Tyga releasing a shocking tell-all book about Kylie and the Kardashian family? In most cases, close friends of the Kardashian family are locked into confidentiality agreements, which prohibit them from speaking publicly about the family. But apparently, Tyga never signed any form of agreement which would allow him to speak publicly if he desires. A family insider recently shared details about the alleged book.  Although Tyga and Kylie Jenner initially tried desperately to conceal their relationship because of Kylie\\'s age, it\\'s no secret he\\'s been in her life for quite some time. Because of that, he\\'s also seen a lot, including how she\\'s evolved over the years. It\\'s quite obvious Kylie\\'s had a number of cosmetic surgeries, but now Tyga reportedly plans to reveal just how many enhancements she\\'s actually had. The insider even insists Tyga was there for many of the surgeries she had.  However, that\\'s not all. The insider also claims Tyga has a staggering amount of incriminating details about Kim Kardashian and Kanye West for his tell-all book. Since Tyga and Kanye have collaborated on records, he\\'s spent lots of time with the Yeezus rapper and his famous wife. But apparently, all of his interactions with the couple haven\\'t been pleasant. In fact, the insider claims Tyga has enough dirt on the couple to write more than one book. For months now, several rumors have circulated about the famous couple\\'s marital problems, but of course, the rumors have not been confirmed.  Reports about Tyga\\'s tell-all book come shortly after their epic break-up on the rapper\\'s 26th birthday. According to People magazine, Kylie Jenner is absolutely furious about her ex-boyfriend\\'s alleged cheating. An insider close to the 18-year-old reality star recently shared details about her reaction to the heart-wrenching breakup.  Although the Kardashian women have a history of on-again, off-again relationships, it looks like this may definitely be the end for Tyga and Kylie Jenner.  Do you think Tyga and Kylie Jenner are completely done? If Tyga released a tell-all book, would you read it? Share your thoughts. ',\n 'Is the Queen preparing abdicate?  His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI announced it through the Vatican, to shock and surprise.  A poised Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands revealed it in a video uploaded to YouTube, and King Juan Carlos of Spain confirmed it by signing a parliamentary bill.  Queen Elizabeth, however, has vowed that abdicate is something she will never do.  Abdication is, after all, a dirty word in the corridors of Royal palaces, especially after the earthquake caused when her uncle Edward VIII quit the throne in 1936 to marry the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson.  And there is no indication that that will ever change.  Yet with the Queen now into her 92nd year, and with the hard-working Duke of Edinburgh choosing to retire last month at the age of 96, plans are afoot which, if implemented, would see Charles appointed King in all but name.  Palace sources have indicated that the Queen has told her inner circle that, if she is still on the throne at the age of 95, she will ask for a piece of legislation called the Regency Act to come into force \u2013 granting her eldest son full power to reign even while she still lives.  I have spoken to a number of high-ranking courtiers who made it clear that preparations for a transition are moving ahead at pace. They have all confirmed that a Regency with Charles taking the lead is now, at the very least, a real possibility.  One senior former member of the Royal Household said: \u2018Out of the profound respect the Queen holds for the institution of monarchy and its stewardship, Her Majesty would want to make sure that she has done everything she can for her country and her people before she hands over. She is dutiful to her core.  \u2018Her Majesty is mindful of her age and wants to make sure when the time comes, the transition of the Crown is seamless.  \u2018I understand the Queen has given the matter considerable thought and believes that, if she is still alive at 95, she will seriously consider passing the reign to Charles.\u2019  Clarence House \u2013 the household of Prince Charles \u2013 is making no comment about Plan Regency, as it has been called. However, it is understood to be a matter of increasingly open discussion at court.  But Palace staff responsible for communications have been ordered to be \u2018up to speed\u2019 on the 1937 Regency Act, which grants power to the heir apparent \u2018in the event of the incapacity of the Sovereign through illness, and for the performance of certain of the Royal functions in the name and on behalf of the Sovereign in certain other events\u2019.  The development is all the more significant as it comes against the backdrop of momentous shifts at court \u2013 a series of senior staff changes and departures at Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, home to the young Royals.  The Queen\u2019s Private Secretary, Sir Christopher Geidt, 55, resigned his position two weeks ago, sparking turmoil and a \u2018wholesale regime change\u2019 \u2013 as revealed in The Mail on Sunday.  His shrewd deputy \u2013 former banker, political adviser and television executive Edward Young, 50 \u2013 will replace Sir Christopher after a suitable handover period.  I understand that a number of other high-profile figures \u2013 many loyal to Sir Christopher \u2013 are poised to leave the Royal Households at Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace after his unexpected exit.  They include Assistant Private Secretary Samantha Cohen, the capable former Press Secretary and Sir Christopher\u2019s number three in the private office. Ms Cohen, who is Australian, is said to be a firm favourite with the Queen.  Falklands and Afghanistan veteran, Vice Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt, the Master of the Queen\u2019s Household, is also said to be weighing up his position. Sir Alan Reid, the Keeper of the Privy Purse, had been due to retire at the end of this year but decided to depart when Prince Philip stepped back from public duties, leaving the job to his deputy, Sir Michael Stevens.  At Kensington Palace, the Duchess of Cambridge has hired a new Private Secretary, Catherine Quinn, who is head of the University of Oxford\u2019s Said Business School. It is understood she will take up her new role in October.  Prince William\u2019s Private Secretary, former Ministry of Defence communications expert Miguel Head, and Prince Harry\u2019s Private Secretary, former Blues and Royals Captain Ed Lane Fox, 40, are also said to be considering their options.  Perhaps significantly, there have been no major staff changes at Clarence House, home to Prince Charles.  Of course, the transition to a world in which significantly more Royal duties are undertaken by the younger generations is already well under way. Next month, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will step into their new roles as full-time working Royals, and Prince Harry will be expected to carry out more engagements at his grandmother\u2019s side.  \u2018As ever, the Queen wants there to be the minimum of fuss,\u2019 said the former member of the Royal Household. \u2018Of course, for obvious reasons, abdication is not even a consideration.\u2019  That is not in doubt. On her 21st birthday in 1947 the then Princess Elizabeth took to the airwaves to make one of her earliest radio broadcasts. Speaking from Cape Town, where she was on tour with her parents and younger sister, it was as unequivocal as it was momentous.  \u2018I can make my solemn act of dedication with a whole Empire listening,\u2019 she said. \u2018I should like to make that dedication now. I declare before you all that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.\u2019  It was a conviction that she confirmed in her Coronation Oath on June 2, 1953.  While it may be acceptable for Queen Beatrix and King Juan Carlos to pass the baton to the next generation, Palace aides still believe the \u2018A word\u2019 is not part of Her Majesty\u2019s vocabulary.  There is no escaping the passage of time, however, or the fact that the Queen, at 91, is the oldest and longest-serving monarch in the history of these islands \u2013 one who is now without the company of Prince Philip, her consort, on the hundreds of engagements she carries out each year.  The monarch is in remarkable health, yet courtiers are increasingly aware that there is only so much a nonagenarian, albeit one with incredible stamina, can realistically be expected to achieve.  Charles has already been filling in for his mother, representing the head of state on foreign trips during her Diamond Jubilee year to Australia and New Zealand.  Earlier this year he went in her place to Canada to mark the nation\u2019s 150th anniversary. On a tour of the Persian Gulf, he represented the Crown and was treated like a king with other Royals bowing to him.  More will no doubt come as the Queen gradually scales back her demanding list of duties.  A Regency, however, would ensure a more formal handover \u2013 and, indeed, the Act was considered in more recent times when the Queen first acceded to the throne.  Documents show that following the Coronation of 1953, the young Elizabeth II intervened to ensure that Prince Philip \u2013 and not her sister Princess Margaret \u2013 would take over as Regent if she were to die or succumb to illness or mental incapacity before Charles, then aged four, reached adulthood. This was not, of course, required.  Times have changed, so with the heir apparent fast approaching his 70th birthday next year, what would it mean in practice today?  Certainly, it is not be a decision to be taken lightly.  To safeguard against a coup, a Regent can only be installed once a decision is taken by at least three of the following: the Sovereign\u2019s consort, in this case the Duke of Edinburgh; the Lord Chancellor, David Lidington; the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow; the Lord Chief Justice, the incoming Sir Ian Burnett; and Master of the Rolls, Sir Terence Etherton.  Clarence House and Buckingham Palace officials have played down this speculation, as one would expect. But as one insider told me: \u2018We are in uncharted territory right now \u2013 a monarchy in transition with a clear shift in power.\u2019 ',\n \"Kim Kardashian talks her surrogate  She's expecting her third child via surrogate.  But the woman carrying Kim Kardashian's unborn child didn't even know she was carrying the super star's baby.  'She didn't know at the beginning,' Kim, 37, revealed during her appearance on the talk show The Real on Thursday.  Asked if it was even safe to tell the surrogate her\\xa0identity, Kim said it was possible to go through the process anonymously.  But she said had fears the surrogate may not even be a fan of hers.  'Well you can do it totally anonymously,' Kim replied.\\xa0 'You could go that route, and I just felt like I wanted, whoever's carrying my baby, like what if they weren't a fan of me or my husband? And what if they didn't want to be carrying our baby?'  Kim said she wanted to develop a relationship with the woman.  'I wanted to give them that choice and be proud and on the same page and I wanted a relationship with her.'  Luckily Kim's surrogate was delighted to learn whose child she was carrying, and was 'proud' to do so, knowing the complications she suffered from during her previous pregnancies.  'She was really excited! She was someone that had watched the show, not like a super fan or anything that it would have been uncomfortable, but she had seen my struggle and seen how open I was about it. So she was really proud to do it, really excited,' Kim said.  Kim recently threw herself a baby shower, though explained she didn't invite the surrogate.  'I, um, I did not [invite her]. I did introduce her to my family. I introduced her to my family earlier that day. And, you know, I just thought, I don\u2019t know, it was like a weird decision to have to make,' said the KUWTK star.  'I think I have to explain it to my kids first and figure out how I\u2019m going to explain it to them.'  Kim insisted there are no ill feelings.  'I love her. I have the best relationship with my surrogate. She\u2019s so nice. She is the perfect person to do this for my family. She\u2019s great. She\u2019s been amazing.'

',\n 'Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Keep Separate Bedrooms  On March 17, first lady Melania Trump, clad in a belted custom Alice Roi coatdress, Gianvito Rossi stilettos and Gucci sunglasses, strode across the White House lawn with her husband, Donald. With the press corps photographers snapping away, the 46-year-old Slovenia-born stunner smiled for the cameras as the billionaire, 70, awkwardly reached for her hand and clutched the tips of her fingers.     Once the obligatory photo op was complete, she, Donald and their 11-year-old son, Barron, boarded Marine One, POTUS\\' helicopter, which whisked them away to their Palm Beach, Florida, estate, Mar-a-Lago. Aboard the chopper - and away from the public eye - Melania dropped the act. And Donald\\'s hand. \"Melania,\" a family source alleges in the new issue of Us Weekly, \"does not keep hidden from everyone around her how miserable she is.\"  That includes the presi\\xaddent himself. Multiple sources claim that the former fashion model - who\\'s currently living 200 miles away from Washington, D.C., in NYC\\'s Trump Tower while Barron finishes the school year - refuses to share a bed with Donald even on the rare occasions when they sleep in the same city. \"They have separate bedrooms,\" says another Trump insider. \"They never spend the night together - ever.\" (A third source says the couple do sleep in the same room but keep separate beds: \"It\\'s very \\'royal\\' of them!\")     Upset with the former reality star for trapping her in a life she despises, \"Melania wants as little to do with Donald as possible,\" explains the family source. \"She is not interested in Donald, the presidency or anything involving him.\" A rep for Melania denies the claims telling Us, \"It\\'s unfortunate that you are going to feature unnamed \\'sources\\' that have provided fictional accounts.\"    Since assuming the role of first lady January 20, Melania has kept an extremely limited official schedule. After the inauguration, she mostly stayed in her gilded Fifth Avenue triplex penthouse and didn\\'t set foot in the nation\\'s capital again for 21 days. And the few official appearances she has made were done so begrudgingly.     Melania escorted Akie Abe, the Japanese prime minister\\'s wife, around Palm Beach in February, but \"only because she was going to be at Mar-a-Lago already,\" according to the family source. \"She refused to do it in Washington.\"     For much more on the Trumps, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!

I\\'m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of \\'journalism,\\' the \\'First Amendment,\\' and \\'celebrity news.\\'\"  \"If I am some kind of symbol to some people out there, then clearly I am an example of the lens through which we, as a society, view our mothers, daughters, sisters, wives, female friends and colleagues. The objectification and scrutiny we put women through is absurd and disturbing.\"  The post went viral-but initially, Aniston wasn\\'t even planning on publishing it. She told Ellen DeGeneres this week that she wrote it at first just for herself. \"You know how we kind of write and don\\'t necessarily send it? Or at least when I was a kid I did that. And yeah, I kind of hit a wall. I was pretty raw at the time, just came back from a vacation. My mother sort of-had sort of?-she passed [away],\" Aniston said.  She and husband Justin Theroux had gone away to the Bahamas in the middle of \"nowhere\". But \"we were mobbed, like a scary kind of mob. Like, I didn\\'t know what was happening. I kept thinking, \\'Is Kim Kardashian behind me or something? This is very strange.\\' And then it turns out that another wonderful photograph, which I\\'ve had to sort of live with for the last 10 to 15 years: a picture of me with a bump and a circle around my stomach with an arrow pointing to it. Just in this sort of kind of objectifying way, and I was just fed up with it.\"  She then poignantly echoed the point she made in her piece: that women are defined by more than just being mothers:  I think these tabloids, all of us, need to take responsibility on what we ingest into our brains. Just because we are women, we have a uterus, we have a vagina, we have ovaries, we need to like, \"Get to work, lady!\" As opposed to, hello, Freedom Medal. We as women do a lot of incredible things in this world other than just procreate-and not that that is not-but it\\'s like we just get boxed in. They love the narrative, they love the story, they love the \"She\\'s jealous of this person, and she\\'s depressed, and oh my god she\\'s never going to have a...\" Whatever the horrible little headline is, we\\'ve just got to break out of that and go whoa, whoa. And women, I have to say, are many of the authors of these horrible articles that are written in these B.S. tabloids. So, we have to stop listening to them, we have to stop buying them because we have to support each other, especially at this time, to love each other, to support, and to be proud of women, of whatever your choice is in life. It\\'s up to us what makes us happy and fulfilled.

That\u2019s what a lot of fans can\u2019t help but wonder as Kris Jenner was spotted taking care of her children, Mason and Penelope Disick near her family home in Calabasas, California on Wednesday, May 24. Kris took her grandchildren to run errands with her while Kourtney was frolicking with her new boy toy Younes Bendjima.  Eyewitnesses say that Kris took Mason and Penelope along with Kim Kardashian\u2019s daughter North West out for frozen yogurt. She\u2019s babysitting her grandchildren while Kourtney and Scott are partying thousands of miles away in Cannes.  A lot of fans can\u2019t help but wonder why Kourtney would still be in Cannes knowing that Scott is there with his new girlfriend Bella Thorne. Apparently, both parents are trying to compete with each other for paparazzi and media attention while their children are back at home.  Sure, Kourtney Kardashian loves her children and puts them first in her life \u2013 she\u2019s proven it plenty of times in the past. But is her new romance with Younes Bendjima getting in the way of her parental responsibilities? That might be the case, especially since a lot of people are pointing out that both Kourtney and Scott are acting like children themselves.  Kourtney has spent the last week showing off her bikini body and making out with Younes in the South of France. Taking a page out of her book, Scott is now doing the same by partying with Bella. He was even spotted getting very up close and personal with her at their hotel pool in Cannes. Clearly, Scott is trying to make a point by cuddling and making out with the former Disney star in the same town as his ex and baby mama.  So far Kourtney has not made any comments about her new relationship with Younes Bendjima. But if there\u2019s one thing for certain, it\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t plan on getting back with Scott Disick anytime soon.  That chapter is closed, done and in the past. Still, many critics can\u2019t help but wonder if Kourtney might be flaunting her relationship with Younes to make Scott jealous. After all, Scott did it to her several times in the past.  Either way, it doesn\u2019t look like Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick\u2019s drama is going to end anytime soon.

',\n 'Did Meek Mill Find Nicki Minaj In A Lesbian Tryst With Young M.A.?  Finding a story about Nicki Minaj and Meek Mill isn\\'t exactly a stretch. Last year, Meek Mill\\'s beef with Canadian rapper Drake kept us entertained for months, and Minaj is hardly low-profile. Over the past few years, Minaj has become known almost as well for her social media fights as for her music. As a result, celebrity watchers always seem to have an eye for the next Meek Mill and Nicki Minaj story. In recent weeks, most stories about Mill and Minaj have focused on whether or not hip-hop\\'s power couple are still dating or not.  In recent days, rumors have emerged claiming that Meek Mill walked into Minaj\\'s dressing room to find her and female rapper Young M.A. in a lesbian tryst. Ace Showbiz has speculated that Meek Mill and Minaj split last month after Meek lost his cool. Mill went on an Instagram rant at Minaj and then deleted his account. The same site reports that MediaTakeOut claims Minaj has become infatuated with female rapper Young M.A. and has split with Meek as a result.  All Hip-Hop claims that Minaj \"plays for both teams\" and says that she certainly has \"rapped some lines over the years that have suggested that she may be a little bi-sexual or certainly bi-curious.\"  Of course, certain media outlets rarely let the truth get in the way of a good story, and it seems that the latest Mill-Minaj split rumors are just exactly that - rumors with no credible evidence to support them. Indeed, a glance at Minaj\\'s Instagram account suggests that Meek Mill and Nicki Minaj are very much together, as they enjoyed Halloween together. Nicki shared a selection of images with her 67 million followers that showed her having fun with Mill.  Gossip Cop reports that the stories claiming Mill and Minaj have split are not only false, they accuse the original source of spreading false stories about the rappers.  \"The webloid\\'s perspective, though, continues to differ from reality. Minaj and Mill are very much still together, as she herself showed on Instagram Monday morning. \"And while the relationship might not last forever, Minaj is not \"dropping\" Mill for Young M.A. MediaTakeOut should probably start looking elsewhere than Twitter and Instagram for its made-up stories.\"  Of course, some might question why Gossip Cop sees itself as the arbiter of truth when it comes to Nicki Minaj and Meek Mill. After all, they seem to rely on the images posted on Minaj\\'s Instagram account as evidence that Meek and Minaj are still an item. One has to wonder if Gossip Cop sees the irony in this, given that they invite another outlet to look beyond Instagram for stories.  Many will wonder why Minaj and Mill do not take legal action against outlets spreading false stories. The truth may lay in Minaj\\'s hunger for publicity. According to Hip-Hop DX, Minaj was recently quoted as saying that Meek Mill\\'s high-profile beefs with the like of Drake are great publicity. Perhaps Minaj believes that all publicity is good publicity.  The reality is that the public has no right to know anything about Mill and Minaj that the couple doesn\\'t want shared publicly. It is easy to claim that Minaj and Mill gave up their rights to privacy when they entered the entertainment industry. There is no doubt that artists like Minaj and Mill exploit the opportunities for publicity social media affords them. Some claim this makes them \"fair game\" for the gossip columns.  The reality is that Nicki Minaj\\'s sexuality is her own affair, and she should not be judged or \"slut-shamed\" for it. The inner workings of Minaj\\'s relationship with Meek Mill are no one\\'s business but their own.

They had a few too many drinks for my taste.\"  Kim - who has 22-month-old son Saint and four-year-old daughter North with the 40-year-old rapper - was shocked to see her pal \"fully butt naked\" in her mother\\'s wardrobe.

Taylor has always been the bigger money earner in all of her relationships. Even though past boyfriends such as Jake Gyllenhaal, John Mayer, Tom Hiddleston, and Calvin Harris were millionaires, their bank accounts still paled in comparison to Taylor\u2019s whopping $300 million estimated net worth.  But, Taylor Swift is now dating relatively unknown actor, Joe Alwyn, who has yet to see big-screen success, and fans are wondering if it\u2019s true or false news that she is spending millions of dollars supporting the relationship. His first film, \u201cBilly Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk\u201d garnered him good reviews from critics, but not much of a paycheck. In fact, Joe has admitted to still living at home with his parents in London.  Taylor Swift met Joe Alwyn last fall through mutual friends and decided to move to London in order to be closer to the struggling actor. She rented a beautiful home in North London close to where Joe\u2019s parents lived. Home rentals in London are some of the most expensive in the world, with some claiming a London rental can cost twice as much as renting elsewhere, but Taylor thought Joe was worth it and signed a six month lease so the two could be together.  Now comes word that she is yet again willing to drop a ton of cash for the actor. Taylor is reportedly shopping for a home for the two of them to share in London\u2019s affluent Chelsea neighborhood. Money is no object and she is willing to pay millions to live in the wealthy neighborhood which other famous Brits, including Pippa Middleton call home.  Although she and Joe will be spending the majority of their time at her house in Los Angeles so he can work on future film roles, Joe is very close to his parents and wants a home close to them so he can visit often and Taylor is willing to make that happen.  It\u2019s not only real-estate that the Grammy winner is willing to spend money on when it comes to her new love. Taylor and Joe have been traveling using her private jets , and just this weekend, the two were seen boarding her private plane in London. The pair first flew to LA to let Joe get settled in Taylor\u2019s home and then the couple headed to Nashville so her new beau could meet her parents.  While it\u2019s true that Taylor Swift apparently doesn\u2019t mind spending millions of dollars on Joe Alwyn, some of the singer\u2019s own fans are starting to feel embarrassed that the pop star is the one footing all the bills and are wondering if a relationship will work out between the two in the long run. Others are just are hoping that with this move to Los Angeles, other movie offers will come in and his career will finally start to take off. Come back to CDL for all your Taylor Swift news and updates. ',\n 'Blake Griffin: Did He Kick His Baby Mama Out For Kendall Jenner?  It\\'s only been a few weeks since the world learned that Blake Griffin and Kendall Jenner are dating, but it looks as though the lanky couple is moving very fast.  They\\'ve been hanging out in public; she\\'s already banned from the Staples Center ...  Yes, they\\'ve checking off items from the \"new Kardashian-professional athlete relationship\" checklist at breakneck speed.  There\\'s just one problem.  Neither Blake nor Kendall was 100 percent single when they met, which means they\\'re both in the process of distancing themselves from their most recent exes as they simultaneously attempt to build a new relationship together.  Insiders say Kendall was still dating A$AP Rocky when she started hooking up with Blake, but it sounds like that situation won\\'t present much of a challenge.  \u201cHe isn\u2019t the type to settle down or be a good boyfriend, so she\u2019s playing the field too,\" one insider said of Rocky.  So we imagine he wasn\\'t too torn up about being cut from Team Kendall.  Blake, on the other hand, is in a bit of a tighter spot.  The LA Clippers forward has two kids with Brynn Cameron, whom he dated for several years.  Though the couple had experienced relationship troubles in recent months and even lived apart during a trial separation, sources say Cameron was blindsided by the news that Griffin was dating Kendall.  According to sources close to the couple, Cameron unexpectedly moved out of the home she previously shared with Griffin this week.  And naturally, many are claiming that Kendall is to blame.  \"Both Brynn and Blake have been staying at rented places since their breakup happened. It seemed like they wanted to give it time for the dust to settle before disrupting the kids with a big move,\" one insider reveals.  \"That said, Brynn feels totally betrayed and mortified that Blake has chosen to be so public with Kendall, and she just wants this whole mess to be over,\" the informant adds.  \"He\u2019s in Clippers training camp now, so she figured it was the perfect time to do it.\"  So it sounds like Blake and Brynn were headed in the vague direction of Splitsville, but Kendall was what drove them to finally call it quits.  Fans are reportedly angry, as Brynn was a beloved member of the Clippers community.  Wait until the NBA season starts and all the \"Kardashian curse\" talk comes with it. ',\n 'Get Busy!

The actor - whose wife Angelina filed for divorce and ended their 12-year relationship following the reported incident - is accused of being \"wasted\" and \"screaming\" while in the air with his partner and two of their children.

The site claims \"Angelina jumped in between them to block her husband\", but it\\'s not clear what led to the alleged incident, or if it was even intentional.  But a source told Mirror Celebs: \"These claims are exaggerated and fabricated. It\\'s unfortunate for the whole family that people are insisting on continuing this endless smear campaign against Brad that hurts everyone.  \"They are a solid family with two caring parents and a normal share of disagreements. Hopefully people can move on and leave them all alone to work this out.\"  Another source added that the FBI is investigating the claims as a jurisdictional issue due to the alleged incident taking place in the air.  The insider added Pitt - who is \"cooperating fully\" with authorities - denies being abusive and wants to do what is best for his children.  As the plane touched down, The Sun reports that the World War Z star allegedly continued his \"rant\" at the 15-year-old before then trying to leave the place in a fuel truck on the tarmac.  The Mirror understands the alleged incident was the tipping point for Jolie to call time on their 12-year relationship.  She split from him the next day.

We still can\\'t get over the fact that the No. 1 diva herself Mariah Carey has agreed to be a judge on \\' American Idol .\\' Of course, with a price tag of $18 million, we\\'re not terribly surprised, but we have a sneaking suspicion she agreed because she feels the need to compete with veteran competitors like \\' X Factor \\' judge Britney Spears and \\' The Voice \\' judge Christina Aguilera .

The pop star could be seen in tears as she exited a private jet on Tuesday afternoon and was greeted by her boyfriend Mac Miller, who was waiting on the tarmac to comfort the 23-year-old singer.  Ariana, who was dressed in head-to-toe black and carrying a purple unicorn onesie, shared a lengthy embrace and kiss with Miller before being whisked away in an SUV caravan to a family member's home in a nearby gated community.  Miller could also been seen warmly embracing Ariana's mother Joan, who like her daughter was dressed entirely in black, and giving her a kiss on the cheek as he helped her into one of the waiting vehicles.  Police cars were also seen surrounding Joan's nearby home, less than 24 hours after 22 people lost their lives and another 119 were injured when a improvised device went off inside Manchester Arena just moments after Ariana performed her final song.  Joan was one of the people in attendance when the bomb exploded on Monday and heading backstage to congratulate her daughter when the night suddenly described into chaos.  Rather than panic however, she immediately got to work helping some of the young concertgoers make their way out of the arena and safely backstage, where she stayed with the group and helped to calm them down amidst the mayhem.  Ariana has yet to speak publicly about the devastating attack, but did post a message on Twitter early Tuesday, writing: 'broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words.'  The pop star has also now indefinitely delayed her much-anticipated European tour, which kicked off in Stockholm on May 8 and was set to wrap up on June 15 in Rome.  She and Joan made a quick and quiet departure from England early Tuesday morning with a little help from fellow pop star Taylor Swift, who lent the two women one of her private jets.\\xa0Sources told TMZ,\\xa0however, that Swift wasn't involved in the process, as the private jet was financed down the middle by Grande's touring corporation Live Nation and manager Scooter Braun.  ISIS is now taking credit for the Monday night massacre, with authorities identifying 22-year-old Salman Abedi as the suicide bomber responsible for the carnage.  The blast from Abedi's improvised devise went off just seconds after Ariana finished her final song of the evening, with some of the injured victims telling authorities that the explosive appeared to be filled with nails and nuts.  Abedi is the British-born son of Libyan immigrants and lived just a few miles from the arena where Ariana performed on Monday.  Police are still investigating whether or not Abedi might have been aided by any accomplices in the attack, and at least one other man has been arrested by authorities in connection with the attack.  That individual, who is 23, has not yet been identified by police.  Investigators are spending a good deal of their time now pouring over the thousands of videos filmed on Monday by Ariana's young fans and the arena's surveillance footage for any clues as to how the attack was planned and who may have helped to carry it out.  Prime Minister Theresa May announced Tuesday evening that the threat level in the country had been raised to critical, meaning an attack could happen imminently in Britain.  If the incident is confirmed as a terrorist attack it would be the deadliest in Britain since four suicide bombers killed 52 London commuters on three subway trains and a bus in July 2005.  Manchester Arena said on its website that the blast struck outside the venue as concertgoers were leaving. Some eyewitnesses said it happened in the foyer of the arena just after the concert ended.  One witness said Grande had just finished her final song and said 'Thank you, Manchester,' before leaving the stage when suddenly there was a loud explosion.  The incident led to a nightlong search for loved ones as parents tried to locate their teenage children and groups of friends scattered by the explosion sought to find one another.  Taxi services offered to give stranded concertgoers rides home for free, and residents opened their homes to provide lodging for people who could not get home because public transport had shut down.  City officials said the true spirit of Manchester would shine through despite the horrendous incident \\xa0while Twitter and Facebook were filled with appeals for information about people who had not been accounted for.  The names of the victims are also slowly becoming public, revealing that most were young female teenagers, no doubt thrilled to be seeing Ariana perform live for the first time.  Eight-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos is the youngest victim who has been identified at this time. Even more tragic is the fact that the young girl's mother Lisa still has no idea\\xa0as she was left critically injured in the blast and is still fighting for her own life.  Saffie's older sister is also being treated for injuries she suffered during the attack.  Georgina Callander, 18, lost her life as well in the attack, just hours after the teenager tweeted at Ariana to let her know how excited she was to see her in concert.  Two years prior, Georgina had got to go backstage and meet Grande after her performance, and later shared one of the photos she took with the pop star.  Saffie and Georgina lived just two miles from one another in the village of Tarleton, and on Tuesday their friends, family, neighbors and even complete strangers gathered to remember the young girls, whose lives were cut tragically short.  Some carried balloons and others flowers while many had signs that read 'I LOVE MCR.'  With the whole of Britain in mourning over this tragedy, both political parties agreed to halt campaigning ahead of the upcoming June 6 election our of respect for the victims.  A number of celebrities also offered up their thoughts and prayers in the wake of Monday night's attack.  David Beckham, who became a global sports superstar while playing for Manchester United, posted on Facebook: 'Heartbreaking news from Manchester. As a father and a human what has happened truly saddens me. My thoughts are with all of those that have been affected by this tragedy...'  His Spice Girl-turned designer wife Victoria, who lived in Manchester after marrying Beckham, added: 'My heartfelt thoughts and prayers for all those effected by the tragedy in Manchester last night.'  Swift, who later offered up her private jet to Ariana, wrote:\\xa0'My thoughts, prayers and tears for all those affected by the Manchester tragedy tonight. I'm sending all my love.'  Katy Perry also commented on the violent attack, saying:\\xa0'Praying for everyone at @arianagrande's show... Broken hearted for the families tonight. Broken hearted for Ari. Broken hearted for the state of this world.'  And Rihanna wrote: 'Manchester has always been so close to my heart! These are innocent vulnerable kids, this could've been any of us! I'm devastated!  'Praying for the beautiful souls we lost, their families and loved ones, for the survivors who will forever be impacted by this #Manchester.'  One of the most poignant remembrances though may have come however from British-born talk show host James Corden, who was taping his late night program in Los Angeles when the attack occurred on Monday.  'It shocks me every time we hear this sort of news, that attacks like this can happen, but especially when there will be so many children at this concert tonight.  'Many of you won't have ever been to Manchester, but you will definitely have heard of it. It's famous all over the world for so many wonderful things, great football teams, Man City, Man United. It's famous for incredible music, Oasis and Joy Division.  'It was the birthplace of the leader of the suffragettes, it's the home of the inventor of the first computer. It's a place full of comedy, and curries, and character.  'But when I think of Manchester, the place that I know, I think of the spirit of the people there, and I'm telling you a more tight knit group of people you will be hard pressed to find.  'Strong, proud, caring people with community at its core, and if it was even possible, the spirit of the people of Manchester will grow even stronger this evening.  'My thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Manchester tonight, all of the staff of the MEN arena, all of the security teams, all of the emergency services, Ariana and her team, and all of those families affected by tonight. We'll all go to bed, holding our little ones even tighter this evening.' \",\n 'FKA Twigs Looks Miserable With Robert Pattinson At Cannes Film Festival | Celeb Dirty Laundry  FKA Twigs and Robert Pattinson are reportedly going strong. The Twilight star and his fianc\u00e9e attended the 2017 Cannes Film Festival this week. The couple didn\u2019t look as happy as they are reported to be. It\u2019s been months since fans have seen FKA Twigs and Robert Pattinson together.  They keep their relationship low-key for the most part. It\u2019s probably because FKA Twig has to deal with the crazy Twilight fans bugging her on social media. She looked really sour when they went to the red-carpet premiere of Robert Pattinson\u2019s latest movie Good Time.  Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs were glowing on the red carpet. While Robert Pattinson seemed ecstatic to be there, his girlfriend struggled to smile during the event. FKA Twigs stood beside him in a busy Dior gown that she paired her look with nude fuzzy boots and a black choker with a gold crucifix hanging from it.  The Daily Mail noticed that she kept looking at the floor as she walked out of their hotel to head to the screening. Robert Pattinson kept it classic with his black tuxedo.  He was later joined by co-stars Taliah Webster and Buddy Duress, writer and co-director Ben Safdie, and co-director Joshua Safdie. Robert Pattinson reportedly got engaged to FKA Twigs back in August 2015. The couple has kept their relationship out of the public eye as much as possible. Despite stepping out together at public events, they rarely speak out about their relationship. Though FKA Twigs has said that the public attention that she has garnered is \u201c100 percent worth it.\u201d  She told The Observer back in 2014 that she is not who she portrays on the red carpet. She only attends these events to support \u201cthe man that I love.\u201d She also remarked about the media who scrutinizes every move on her red carpet. FKA Twigs admits that she looks uncomfortable at red carpet events because they are not her thing. But, that doesn\u2019t stop her from loving and supporting Robert Pattinson.  Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs were all smiles when they celebrated his 31st birthday earlier this month in Culver City, Los Angeles. The actor beamed and even displayed PDA with FKA as they joined friends at an intimate party at Akasha restaurant. However, FKA Twigs seemed engaged with her phone every time Robert Pattinson was talking about something. The couple were later seen hugging and kissing each other outside the venue.

Inside The Shocking Claims  Angelina Jolie is famous for adopting kids from around the world, but did she obtain her first son, Maddox, using falsified documents? Maddox\\'s real Cambodian father has come forward with the shocking claims that Jolie doesn\\'t have legal power of attorney over the 15-year-old.  According to Celebrity Dirty Laundry, Mounh Sarath says that he has official paperwork from Cambodia that confirms he is Maddox\\'s father. Jolie started Maddox\\'s adoption back in 2002, and Brad Pitt legally adopted him in 2006. But according to Sarath, he actually has power of attorney over the teenager.  Sarath and Jolie have not spoken to each other in years. Even more scandalous, the adoption agent Jolie worked with, Lauryn Galindo, was jailed for falsifying names, birth places, and dates of children from Cambodia. At the time Jolie adopted Maddox, the United States had just set forth stricter adoption laws for children from Cambodia. Did she rush the process to bypass the stricter laws?  The Sun reports that Sarath works in charity and local aid in Cambodia. Given his falling out with Jolie and the circumstances surrounding Maddox\\'s adoption, Sarath\\'s opinion of the Tomb Raider star is pretty low.  \"I would be happy if Cambodia didn\\'t see her again,\" he added.  Jolie\\'s interest in Cambodia started when she filmed her 2001 hit film in the country, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. She recently directed a movie based in Cambodia, First They Killed My Father, and has visited the country on several different occasions.  The allegations against Angelina Jolie couldn\\'t have come at a worse time. The actress is currently engaged in a heated custody battle with her ex-husband and just returned from promoting her newest film in Cambodia.  Maddox was also the source of a lot of controversy in Jolie\\'s split with Pitt. Shortly after filing for divorce, reports surfaced that Pitt had physically abused Maddox on a private plane. Pitt was eventually cleared of all the accusations, but not before his public image took a major hit.  Things between Maddox and Jolie, meanwhile, couldn\\'t be better. Hollywood Life reports that Jolie took Maddox and his five siblings on a week-long trip to London. During their stay, Jolie and Maddox ventured off to Buckingham Palace for a mother-son date.  The pair was spotted leaving the royal palace and looked happier than ever spending time together. It isn\\'t clear if they actually met any members of the royal family, but there\\'s a possibility they mingled with Prince William.  The outing came after Jolie gave a speech at the London School of Economics. Jolie spoke to a crowd of students about her career promoting human rights around the globe. The actress, who has been an avid human rights activist over the years, also spoke at the United Nations in London.  Maddox was the only member of the Jolie-Pitt family that accompanied Jolie to the palace. Earlier last week, Jolie was spotted taking Maddox\\'s siblings out to a toy store in London. The kids have since returned to the United States.  As far as Jolie and Pitt are concerned, insiders claim that the drama is starting to cool down. Although they haven\\'t finalized the divorce, a source revealed that they are at a better place in their breakup and are on the verge of working things out.  Given how their divorce played out in the early months, it\\'s definitely good to hear that Jolie and Pitt are working through their differences. They have not released an official comment on Maddox\\'s adoption.  Tell us! Do you think Angelina Jolie could have actually faked the documents to adopt Maddox? Let us know in the comments below.

The freaked-out diva has become obsessed with her late ex-husband, Sonny Bono, and believes she\u2019ll join him soon, shocked pals told The National ENQUIRER in a bombshell world exclusive.  \u201cCher truly believes the end is near for her,\u201d said a family pal. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it! She\u2019s scaring the hell out of everyone.\u201d  According to the source, the 69-year-old showbiz legend spends most of her time revisiting her past with Sonny, her longtime performing partner who died on Jan. 5, 1998, at the age of 62.  \u201cIt\u2019s all about Sonny nowadays,\u201d said the source.  Most disturbing of all, \u201cshe\u2019s been paying secret visits to Sonny\u2019s grave and giving away many of her possessions,\u201d added the source.  Sonny and Cher were married from 1964 to 1975, and charted six Top 10 hits, including the classics, \u201cI Got You Babe\u201d and \u201cThe Beat Goes On.\u201d  He was killed in a horrible skiing accident in Nevada and is buried near Palm Springs, Calif., where he served as mayor and later was elected to Congress.  \u201cCher goes to his gravesite with flowers and comes back all weepy and looking like death warmed over,\u201d said the source. \u201cShe\u2019s even cried, \u2018I\u2019m ready to be with Sonny again.\u2019\\u2009\u201d  As The ENQUIRER reported in April, the Oscar-winning \u201cMoonstruck\u201d star \u2013 who is worth a reported $320 million \u2013 is suffering from both physical ailments, and the stress of a turbulent personal life.  At the time, she was also dealing with her disastrous D2K concert tour, which was plagued by infighting, lawsuits and medical woes that left a \u201cdevastated\u201d Cher canceling 23 shows.  Dealing with her children has also taken a debilitating toll on the \u201cMask\u201d star, insiders said. Last year Cher forced her estranged son, Elijah Blue Allman, and his new bride to leave her Malibu home, which she believes is haunted by Sonny.  She\u2019s also deeply concerned that her transgendered and outspoken son, Chaz, could be a target by appearing at gay pride rallies.  Meanwhile, the \u201cBelieve\u201d singer\u2019s longtime battle with the Epstein\u2013Barr virus has wreaked havoc on her heart and kidneys.  At the time of her first bout with the viral infection \u2013 during which she vanished for five months in the early 1990s \u2013 Cher told a friend: \u201cThis disease makes me feel bone-weary, deeply depressed \u2013 and as though all my muscles have turned to Jell-O!\u201d  As The ENQUIRER reported at the time, her publicist told us that doctors had outfitted her with a heart monitor after continuing kidney woes.  When contacted about the specific allegations in this story, her spokesperson Liz Rosenberg told The ENQUIRER that Cher had fully recovered and any claims that she\u2019s headed for an early grave were false and inaccurate.  But recent photographs of a somber Cher on a visit to St. Tropez were telling: She had to be supported by friends who firmly grasped her arms, believing she was close to collapse. \u201cCher\u2019s been there before and always loved it. But she regrets never having visited with Sonny,\u201d said the source.  \u201cThey planned on going a number of times, but something always happened.  \u201cNow, Cher wanted to go with Sonny on her mind. She\u2019s calling it the visit she and Sonny \u2018always wanted but never had.\u2019 It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d  Despite the trip, the frustrated entertainer has confined herself to her Malibu mansion.  \u201cCher has a golf cart that she loves,\u201d said one local. \u201cShe used to be seen driving [it] around Malibu with a hat and glasses. She would wave to people and chat, but those little rides seem to be a thing of the past.\u201d  Other Malibu sources told The ENQUIRER that Cher seems \u201cvery isolated,\u201d while former members of her inner circle are saddened to see her spending her days in bed using a laptop to rant on social media about politics.  \u201cHer management even went to Cher to say she\u2019s got to tone it down, because she\u2019s coming across as angry,\u201d another source said. \u201cBut she told them to f\u2013k off.\u201d  Added the friend: \u201cIt\u2019s like Cher knows it\u2019s all over, and she\u2019s ready to go.

Photos of the TV host all smiles with the unknown woman only fuelled speculations of their separation.  According to reports, DeGeneres stepped out with the mystery brunette on June 1. She enjoyed a vegan meal with the mystery woman at Crossroads in West Hollywood. The host seemed to be in a jolly mood as she and her date left the restaurant.  Photos emerged of the pair leaving the restaurant and walking the street. DeGeneres did not seem perturbed by the attention and at one point even waved at the camera. She also continued to smile for the paparazzi. Meanwhile, the mystery brunette appeared bothered by all the attention and continued to keep her head down. DeGeneres\\' wife de Rossi was nowhere to be found.  DeGeneres\\' date supposedly came after she and de Rossi were spotted bickering at each other at a restaurant. The host\\'s cheerful demeanor with her mystery date supposedly also differs from the previous weeks, when she appeared tense with de Rossi.  Photos of DeGeneres with the mystery brunette only seem to fuel rumors about her divorce with de Rossi. However, the host has since denied these claims. She told People\\xa0in a previous interview that her marriage with de Rossi remains intact. \"I can\\'t imagine not being married. I have my best friend, the person I want to spend time with more than anybody else in the world,\" DeGeneres said.  Likewise, she shut down rumors about her divorce with de Rossi in an interview with Howard Stern on Sirius XM. \"We really don\\'t almost break up, we don\\'t fight, we\\'re madly in love, and I guess it\\'s boring,\" DeGeneres said as quoted by Entertainment Tonight.  DeGeneres also admitted that she does not read the tabloid. She does not pay attention to the divorce rumors surrounding her marriage to de Rossi. This probably explains why she appears cheerful and at ease during her date with the mystery brunette.

We have learned that Kim Kardashian wants to have a much more political image and she\u2019s already making the first few steps in that direction.  According to a source close to the famous family, Kim would like to hire herself a political publicist and Kanye West has been looking for one.  In a recent interview with Harper\u2019s Bazaar Arabia, Kim revealed that she\u2019d love to become a more politically active celeb but is scared of making any mistakes and offending people.  \u2018Sometimes I feel like I want to speak out more about political issues. You have to be really careful about what you say, because a lot of things can be taken in the wrong context and I always want to be respectful; I do not want to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings. I said once before that I am not really a feminist. But I feel like I do a lot more than people that claim that they are feminist. To clarify what I said before: I feel in my soul I am a feminist. I just don not need labels to make me feel or know what I am inside,\u2019 the Kardashian explained.  She went on to say that for her, feminists are all of the girls around us and on social media that stand up for themselves and for certain issues.

',\n 'Miley Cyrus \\'In Tears,\\' May Quit \\'The Voice\\' Amid Epic War With Adam Levine And Blake Shelton?  The Voice TV singing competition show is fond of using fighting metaphors, from battle rounds to knock-outs. But this season, there\\'s speculation that there are just as many battles being fought when the cameras are turned off as when viewers are watching. Is new coach Miley Cyrus secretly involved in a war with seasoned coaches Adam Levine and Blake Shelton?  Billboard pointed out that when it comes to the impressions of Miley and the other new coach, Alicia Keys, they\\'re hitting the high notes of a position that can challenge even the most accomplished singer.  Coaches are tasked with taking on aspiring crooners, guiding them through the competition and providing them with tips on everything from stage presence to blending with the band. Even though Blake and Adam are experienced at banter, Cyrus and Keys immediately showed they were up to the challenge of teasing the guys while luring the best contestants onto their teams.  But what viewers can\\'t see is the drama unfolding among Shelton, Levine, and Miley, according to OK. The battle has become so intense that Cyrus was hurt to the point of tears, and now she\\'s doing her best to stay on the show and avoid quitting.  Team Miley seems to be rocking it when it comes to attracting the best wanna-be singers on the show, but sources cited by OK revealed that the \"Wrecking Ball\" singer is struggling because of the incessant feuding. However, even though she\\'s battling both Blake and Adam, she is trying to stay strong, added one of the insiders.  Cyrus has \"been in tears\" during the filming of the singing competition TV show, with her tears caused by Adam \"constantly\" picking on her, revealed the source. Levine allegedly didn\\'t stop with annoying Miley himself. Instead, he also persuaded his buddy Blake to \"gang up\" on the younger singer, added the insider.  Moreover, the feud reportedly has been gradually building to a crescendo, with Cyrus and Adam \"at each others\\' throats\" since the first day of filming, according to the source.  \"[Levine] wants nothing to do with [Miley],\" summed up the insider.  Even though Adam has recruited Blake to help him annoy Cyrus, the source shared that it\\'s Levine who is focused on feuding.  As for just how bad it\\'s gotten, Cyrus has threatened that she will quit The Voice as a result of the environment becoming \"so bad,\" added the insider.  Alicia Keys is noticeably absent from the feud allegations, and Miley recently commented on reports that she and Alicia had teamed up so that for the first time, two female coaches could challenge Blake and Adam.  Dishing with Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon, Miley clarified that she had not chosen to unite with Alicia in order to have a \"boys against girls\" competition on The Voice. Instead, she has been siding with Keys because being sandwiched between Adam and Blake was infuriating, reported 98.7 Radio.  Despite reports claiming that Levine is bickering with Cyrus, she told Jimmy that in reality, it\\'s Adam and Shelton who are arguing constantly.  \"It never stops,\" she revealed about the bickering between Blake and Adam. \"Even when the cameras are off, that is real.\"  Cyrus admitted that when she viewed the show, she assumed that the playful banter was just done for the cameras. But rather than end when filming stops, Levine and Shelton keep right on bickering.  \"I always thought it was like a little thing they do on camera, no, it\\'s all day,\" she summed up.

The Voice judge, 24, was ordered to hide the truth by record bosses to avoid   turning off male fans, the unauthorised biography says.  They advised the star to say she was a bisexual who liked boys AND   girls, because that was trendy.  But the sensational book alleges the singer-songwriter has not had a   boyfriend since realising she was a lesbian at 17.  The book, Jessie J: Who\\'s Laughing Now, says Jessie took the advice of music   executives because she was scared of losing her Universal record deal.  Author Chloe Govan says: \"Jessie might have been with boys in the past - but   she is 100 per cent gay. Jessie was openly lesbian and didn\\'t hide it.  \"She was advised not to come out, though. Certain people thought being bi was   trendy, exotic and a fashion statement. It would increase her allure.  \"Being gay would alienate people. They knew how important image was and asked   her to tone it down a bit.  \"There are so many homophobes out there, they feared a career-damaging   backlash.\"  Jessie - who admits fancying fellow singer Rihanna - is said to have been   \"incensed\" at having to compromise.  She said in a recent interview: \"If I meet someone and I like them, I don\\'t   care if they\\'re a boy or a girl.\"  The book, out today, also talks about Jessie\\'s battles with her health and   bullying she faced.  When she was 11 she learned she had the heart condition Wolff-Parkinson-White   syndrome. It can speed up the heart rate to four times normal.  Jessie had a stroke aged 18 but never let her illness get in the way of her   ambitions.  She even took ballet lessons while wearing a heart monitor.  She was also prescribed beta blockers - but was picked on when their side   effects turned her pale skin a greenish tinge.

We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details that he wanted to avoid an awkward run-in with Beyonc\u00e9 at all costs.  There\u2019s a good reason that Kanye West, 40, skipped the celebrity wedding of the season when tennis great Serena Williams married Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, 35 in a lavish New Orleans wedding on Nov. 16. While wife Kim Kardashian, 37, attended the big event, he knew that Serena\u2019s close pal Beyonce, 36, was going to be on hand and he didn\u2019t want an awkward confrontation. Especially after he dragged Bey and hubby JAY-Z, 47, so viciously during a Sacramento concert in Nov. of 2016. \u201cIt was no accident that Kanye chose to avoid Serena\u2019s wedding. Kanye is not particularly close with Serena, or her husband, who are more Kim\u2019s friends so Kanye opted out of what he felt may be an awkward evening for him. Kanye knew that Beyonc\u00e9, a close friend of Serena\u2019s, would likely be at the wedding which might make for an uncomfortable situation,\u201d a Yeezy insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cKanye still has a lot of unresolved issues with Beyonc\u00e9 and her husband. So, Kanye told Kim that he was going to sit this one out as to prevent causing a scene and risk stealing attention away from Serena\u2019s big day, which Kim agreed was the smart decision,\u201d our source continues. Yeezy hasn\u2019t come face to face with Bey or Jay since his epic concert rants against them and the worst place for that to happen would be at a joyous event like someone\u2019s wedding. See pics of guests at Serena\u2019s wedding, here.  Kim played it safe and made it a girl\u2019s trip to Serena\u2019s big nuptials, bringing along sister Khloe\u2018s BFF Malika Haqq, 34, and her sis Khadijah Haqq, 34, as her dates instead of her hubby. Beyonc\u00e9 also appeared to want to keep the attention on Serena and not any beef she or Jay might still have with Yeezy by leaving her husband at home as well. Kim and Beyonc\u00e9 have never been close, and so no one expected any fireworks with those two being in the same room. They were both seated in the front row for Serena\u2019s wedding, but were separated by Bey\u2019s former Destiny\u2019s Child bandmate Kelly Rowland, 36, and her husband Tim Weatherspoon. The night belonged to the tennis G.O.A.T.\u2019s  fairytale wedding and not anyone else\u2019s drama.

The young makeup mogul\u2019s life inexperience in the face of such a huge change may be to blame for her meltdown.

She is feeling so alone!\u2019 the source added.  And while Kylie has been craving her mom\u2019s care and help through this confusing change, Kris is reportedly way too busy to give Kylie the attention she needs.  In addition, Kris was planning to offer her youngest daughter a big spin-off show about her life as a young mother as well as an awesome pregnancy reveal but Kylie is getting way too impatient of staying hidden after so many years of enjoying the spotlight.  \u2018Kylie\u2019s just tired of being in hiding. She hates that she has to keep it a big secret for Kris. It has created a lot of tension between the two of them and there was already a lot of tension, to begin with,\u2019 the spy dished.

The recently-fired Today Show host has moved back to Los Angeles after his now-infamous 2005 Access Hollywood interview with Donald Trump was leaked.  But sources told Page Six that Sydney Davis, Bush\\'s wife of 18 years, is furious about the tape and less than happy to have him back at home with their three daughters.  \\'She was so furious that she refused to speak with him for a while,\\' an NBC insider told the site. \\'They are having marriage problems.\\'  In the tape, Bush can be heard calling actress Arianne Zucker \\'hot as s***,\\' and also saying nothing while Trump makes lewd comments about his co-host Nancy O\\'Dell.  But the moment that really angered Davis, a source claims, was when Bush, after gawking at Zucker\\'s legs, asked her if she would give him and the Donald \\'a little hug\\'.  \\'It wasn\\'t just the vile talk,\\' the source said. \\'It\\'s because he insisted the woman hug him and Trump. It was creepy.\\'  Bush, 45, later released an apology for the interview and said he was \\'embarrassed and ashamed\\', but did not make any mention of Davis.  \\'I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along,\\' he said in the statement. \\'I\\'m very sorry.\\'  The source said Davis is enraged that Bush \\'was stupid enough to put himself in that position\\' and has now lost what could have been a life-changing gig.  \\'Billy has brought him on himself,\\' they said. \\'He\\'s blown his big chance at Today and he doesn\\'t have his old job at Access [Hollywood] to fall back on.\\'  \\'He fears his career is over. His wife is angered that he has embarrassed her and their daughters.\\'  Bush refused to comment on the article to Page Six, telling the site: \\'I cannot take this call.\\'  Davis has also never released a statement about the incident, but on Saturday she did reappear on her husband\\'s Instagram.  Bush returned to social media nearly two weeks after first confirming he was leaving The Today Show, posting a picture of him and Davis in the great outdoors.  \\'Hiking with lady long legs,\\' he wrote in the caption. \\'Nice to get out.\\'  It was the first photo Bush, 45, had shared on Instagram in three weeks.  Davis features prominently in Bush\\'s Instagram, most recently visiting him in New York with their daughters just before the hot mic scandal.  \\'Teaching the squad about the NYC Subway ONLY way to go,\\' Bush wrote in one caption, adding that his daughters hated when he said the word \\'squad\\'.  In another photo him and Davis posted with their daughter on her 18th birthday as she received her first tattoo.  Bush, who worked at Access Hollywood for 15 years, had only held his new job at Today for two months when he was given the boot following the Trump scandal.  Matt Lauer confirmed Bush\\'s contract had been terminated \\'effective immediately\\' on an episode of the Today Show last week.  Lauer closed out by saying: \\'All of us here at Today wish Billy the very best.\\'  Tamron Hall also acknowledged Bush\\'s departure later in the show, saying: \\'As a longtime member of the NBC family, we wish Billy all the best as he moves forward.\\'  Bush said in a statement following the announcement that he was \\'deeply grateful\\' for the conversations he\\'d had with his three teenage daughters.  \\'I look forward to what lies ahead,\\' he added.  Although speculation has swirled regarding where Bush might go next - including to the rumored future Trump TV - he has not yet confirmed his next step.  Instead it seems Bush has been busy trying to return to life in Los Angeles, even putting up his luxury Manhattan townhouse on the market for $8.2million.  Bush had purchased the building for $8.8million just last December.  It was initially reported that Bush walked away from NBC with $10million, but both his lawyer and additional sources said the figure was inaccurate.  Instead it is believed NBC would only pay some of the remainder of Bush\\'s $3million-a-year contract, according to CNN Money.  Exact details of the settlement are not known at this time but sources said the contract does not include a non-compete clause, meaning Bush can look for jobs at rivals stations.  Bush\\'s attorney Marshall Grossman spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about the interview with Trump, saying that Bush would have been risking his job if he had not laughed at Trump\\'s statements and made lewd comments of his own.  \\'If Billy had been passive or responded \"Shut the f*** up\" to Trump, Billy would have been out of a job the next day,\\' said Grossman.  But one source told the Daily Mail Online that Bush had bragged about the tape while covering the Olympics this summer in Rio.  \\'What is stunning is how self-important Billy is,\\' the source said.  \\'Many people believe Access Hollywood management knew about this for much longer than they are saying and they were protecting Billy while not doing the right thing and informing NBC News.\\' ',\n 'MTO EXPLOSIVE TEA: Word Coming Out Of BARBADOS . . . .

Our snitch continued, even speculating that if Rihanna is pregnant, the most likely father is PRINCE HARRY \u2013 who was seen flirting with the Bajan Queen a month ago. MediaTakeOut.com\\'s insider explained, \"When the Prince [Harry] was here, he flirted with Robyn [Rihanna] and they ran off together without security. My guess is that he is the father [if Rihanna is in fact pregnant].\"  And our snitch is not the only ones.

He will face off with the power couple in court on November 17, Judge Ruth Kwan ruled on Friday, unless they can reach a settlement before then.  Given Kardashian and West\\'s aggressive stance so far, however, that seems unlikely.  On March 14, Kardashian and West filed a motion to quash Hurley\\'s attempt to have the case dismissed under California\\'s anti-SLAPP statute, arguing that they \"generally object to the entirety\" of Hurley\\'s argument and the judge ruled in their favor.

You are a bad*** bitch, Kim.\u201d  The US reality star has barely been seen in public since her Paris ordeal, when she was bound and robbed at gunpoint in a reported \u00a38.5million heist.

And Jennifer Lopez added another dashing co-star to her repertoire as she was spotted filming with Milo Ventimiglia on Monday.  The superstar, 48, looked casual chic in an off-the-shoulder sweater as the two actors shot a romantic date scene for Second Act.  Daring to impress, Jennifer was seen walking to set in a fur-lined black parka over a grey sweater and camouflage pants.  Her trademark chestnut tresses were left long and loose as they cascaded over her petite shoulders.  The Shades Of Blue actress turned on the charm as she looked deeply into Milo's eyes over glasses of red wine in the Italian restaurant.  Sporting his usual mustache, the This Is Us hunk, 40, rocked a grey button down as he seemed in serious conversation with his dinner date.  Second Act has Jennifer returning to her romantic comedy roots that made her a household name.  Peter Segal will direct the film - which was developed by STXfilms with Jennifer from an idea conceived by Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas and Justin Zackham.  The movie is in the vein of Maid In Manhattan - a huge hit for Jennifer - and Working Girl - the Oscar winning comedy from 1988.  Jennifer will play a big-box store employee who reinvents her life and gets the chance to prove that street smarts are as valuable as a college degree.  Leah Remini is attached to portray the best friend and fellow employee of Jennifer's character while Vanessa Hudgens will play a boss at a consumer goods company.

In a slap in the face to America\u2019s courageous wounded warriors, First Lady MICHELLE OBAMA used Walter Reed Army Medical Center as her own personal outpatient plastic surgery clinic, The National ENQUIRER has learned.  \u201cIt\u2019s appalling!\u201d fumed Jill Farrell of Judicial Watch. \u201cWith taxpayers picking up the tab for her ski trips to Aspen and beach outings to Hawaii, we might as well pay for her abs and butt, too!\u201d  Michelle was whisked to the hospital with \u201cthe utmost secrecy\u201d in the summer of 2011, a source told The ENQUIRER.  \u201cSecret Service agents were stationed both inside and outside the operating room. Michelle had fat sucked from her abdomen, hips and butt.\u201d  While such procedures can take up to two hours, \u201cshe was done in 45 minutes to an hour.\u201d  What\u2019s more, the source added, \u201cWhen elective surgery is done, even if it\u2019s cosmetic, the surgeon\u2019s fee is waived. If Michelle paid anything, it would have been just for the anesthesiologist.  \u201cBecause Michelle is First Lady though, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the government picked up the total tab, meaning taxpayers forked over their hard-earned dollars to satisfy her vanity!\u201d  The ENQUIRER has also learned Michelle, 51, has likely had more than just liposuction at such military facilities.

He added: \u201cHer lips are fuller, indicating fillers into both upper and lower lips. Besides that, her marionette lines [running down from the corners of her mouth] are almost completely gone.\u201d  Respected plastic surgeon Dr. Steven Dayan added: \u201cShe has a decrease in the height of her smile, which can happen when a lot of filler is placed in the cheeks and smile lines.\u201d  The experts\u2019 conclusions further incensed Jill, who charged: \u201cMichelle Obama is taking up needed space while veterans are awaiting care and suffering.

Kathy Griffin, 56, has a reputation of pushing the limits when it comes to comedy, but a lot of people felt like her recent stunt went too far. After posing for photographer Tyler Shields, 35, where she held a bloody Donald Trump head, the public expressed some massive outrage and hardcore backlash \u2014 she even got fired from CNN\u2019s annual NYE special.

Pushed Over Edge by Anniversary of Mom\\'s Funeral  Pushed Over Edge by Anniversary of Mom\\'s Funeral  Kanye West just snapped a week ago Monday in what we\\'re told was a \"nervous breakdown\" ... triggered in large part by the anniversary of his mother\\'s death.  Sources very close to Kanye tell TMZ ... he was increasingly becoming a powder keg of emotions in the weeks leading up to his hospitalization at the UCLA Medical Center ... fueled by what we\\'re told was a shocking lack of sleep and the pressures of touring, running his businesses, parenting and providing emotional support to his wife who was suffering her own emotional trauma after the Paris robbery.  But our sources say the trigger for the breakdown was Donda\\'s death back in November 2007. Her funeral was November 20 -- the same day he cancelled his show at the L.A. Forum. The following day -- November 21 -- Kanye cancelled the remainder of the tour and hours later suffered the breakdown.  People close to Kanye tell us he never effectively grieved over his mom\\'s death and has always had a difficult time in November, but this time he reached the breaking point.  Kanye, we\\'re told, has had trouble handling stress over the last few months, and in the week or so before the breakdown he started to unravel.  As we reported ... Kanye became paranoid when he was taken to UCLA ... refusing for a time to even let doctors touch him. He also ranted that people were trying to ruin his marriage.  Kanye was sedated and is being treated by doctors and mental health professionals. Doctors hoped to release him 2 days ago, but that didn\\'t happen and so far ... no new release date.

Justin definitely needs some time off after slamming awards shows as fake and hollow.\\xa0The vacation photos started popping up on Justin\\'s Instagram on May 25. Looks as if Justin went camping with an assortment of friends. The singer, who normally writes very little or nothing at all on his social media posts, wrote, \"These are the nights I live for.\"  While taking some time off Justin is jet-skiing, maybe doing a little cliff diving and just hanging out. Justin looks pretty relaxed in the photos. On May 27 Justin posted a selfie on Instagram \u2013 he appears to be relaxing by the pool with palm trees in the background.  But what\\'s going on with the Purpose Tour? Checking out Justin\\'s website all previous concert dates have been removed. You can\\'t tell for certain if Justin scheduled time off or decided at the last minute to take a vacation because he\\'s burned out.  The first signs that Justin Bieber might need a break came when the singer went on blast telling everyone that just because you buy a CD doesn\\'t mean you are entitled to stop him in the street like he\\'s your bestie. You buy a CD and that\\'s all you\\'re entitled to, a CD, not a piece of Justin.  Next Justin kind of snapped after the Billboard Music Awards saying all these awards shows are all fake, shallow and meaningless. Yet a few days later Justin profusely thanked the Teen Choice Awards for the three nominations he received. Once again, Justin used Instagram to express himself.  The Purpose Tour resumes on June 11 with several stops in Canada and then through the United States through July 19. After two Tokyo shows in August the tour resumes in Europe in September and runs non-stop through the end of November.  A schedule like that might cause any entertainer to put a tour on hold for a couple of weeks. Hopefully Justin will get some much needed R&R and put all the controversy behind him when the tour resumes.  Justin Bieber was spotted out and about in Los Angeles, California on May 27, 2016.

WHY?!  \"THE Real Housewives of Miami\" may be fun to watch on TV, but one of the couples on the Bravo reality show drove Rosie O\\'Donnell right out of her ritzy neighborhood!  The outspoken comedian couldn\\'t stand living near Lisa Hochstein and her plastic surgeon husband Dr. Lenny \"Boob God\" Hochstein on exclusive Star Island, so she sold her home of 18 years for a whopping $16.5 million.  \"It was getting a little CRAZY with all those tour boats and that Miami Show...The Beverly...The Mom of Miami, whatever it is, Housewives,\" Rosie told a radio interviewer.  An insider added: \"Rosie thinks the Hochsteins are crass and totally classless, and all the nosy fans and camera crews that come with being a \\'Housewife\\' were driving her nuts.  \"She loved Star Island and many of her neighbors. She really thought she would grow old there. But because of Lisa and her husband, she decided to sell her home.\"  Things hit rock bottom for Rosie last October with the heavy media coverage of the Hochsteins\\' Halloween party \u2013 which featured a black Jesus bound to a crucifix, a bloody zombie giving \"birth\" to a stillborn baby, and other creepy and bloody displays.  About that time, mother-of-five Rosie was contacted by a real estate agent who asked if she was interested in putting her mansion up for sale, and the en\\xadtertainer gave a resounding yes.  The former talk-show host, who married executive-search consultant Michelle Rounds in 2012 and adopted a baby girl with her, reportedly bought a $5 million home in the far sleepier Sarasota, Fla., area.  \"Rosie thought about organizing the community to pressure the neighbors from hell to move,\" said the source. \"But with a new wife and baby, she decided to take the high road and simply find a new home.\"  First, a new old job \u2013kinda - \\xa0\\xa0a return to \"The View\".

Be honest. It\u2019s OK.\u201d  As the small crowd of ticket winners began to murmur nervously, Jay-Z announced, \u201cI can answer for y\u2019all because I am free. Because I recognized Jesus is the original fake news, designed to enslave humanity.\u201c  \u201cI\u2019m telling you this because I know you guys look up to me and want to emulate me. I will give you this one guarantee, if you start following the doctrine of Lucifer, you will taste success. The secret of the universe opens up to you. It is immediate and glorious.\u201d  The 99 Problems rapper also hinted at his Satanic beliefs onstage, telling audiences to ignore the rules of the venue and the security staff trying to enforce them. Instead of respecting the rules, Jay-Z instructed his audience to \u201cDo what thou wilt\u201c.  It has long been known that Jay-Z is a follower of Aleister Crowley, the English occultist and founder of the Satanic religion Thelema.  The religion is founded upon the idea that the 20th century marked the beginning of the Aeon of Horus, in which a new ethical code would be followed; \u201cDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law\u201c. This statement indicates that adherents, who are known as Thelemites, should seek out and follow their own true path in life, known as their True Will.  Jay-Z\u2019s Satanic preaching is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the rapper has shared with the dark side. After starting his career as an aspirational rapper, he reinvented his image as a dark lord, flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as he rode to the top of the rap game.  Since establishing himself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer, Jay-Z has attempted to tone down his dark image, however the disturbing conversation he held in New Orleans suggests he is far from a reformed character, and he has openly embraced the darkest forces in our society.  The incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan, and have begun openly promoting dark spirituality as a viable religious choice for those seeking guidance. \",\n 'Where Was Maks?

She emphatically denied that she had any work done on her face to her own sisters on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, but now the truth is out.  Khloe Kardashian has admitted that she got facial fillers on the latest episode of her chat show Kocktails With Khloe, but it didn\u2019t work out how she wanted.  The 31-year-old reality star, who has overhauled her image since her split from former NBA star Lamar Odom, revealed that she had a few bits done but didn\u2019t like the results.  \u201cMy face was f****d!\u201d she was heard telling her guests on the show.  Talking to plastic surgeon Dr Terry Dubrow, of the TV show Botched on her TV show, Khloe revealed how the look just didn\u2019t work for her and she returned to get the filler \u201cdissolved\u201d.  \u201cIt did not work for me. I looked crazy, and I still think the effects are in there - I went to have it all dissolved like three times,\u201d she said.  Khloe insisted that the first time she had the work done was before Lamar\u2019s \u2018accident\u2019 in October last year, when he was found unconscious in a Nevada brothel after a wild weekend.  \u201cI did it and then Lamar\\'s accident happened,\u201d Khloe explained, claiming that the result was affected by the athlete\u2019s collapse.  \u201cI was so stressed out the doctor was like, \u2018I think it\\'s just too much was happening to your real emotions\u2019,\u201d she said.

And I\\'m almost like, I swear things are still in my face.\u201d  Khloe previously denied having any fillers, and was seen in the season finale of the family\u2019s reality show telling her own sisters \u2013 Kim and Kourtney \u2013 that she had not received any treatment when quizzed about her changing look.  In scenes that aired in January, following Kris\u2019 60 Great Gatsby-themed birthday bash in November, Kim is heard speaking to Khloe on the phone.  \u201cKhloe, I was gonna call you and talk to you last night about this,\\' Kim said. \u201cYour whole face has changed.

Khloe, 31, bared her bra in a see-through white tank top which she teamed with a pair of form-fitting white jeans.  She completed her look with a pair of aviator sunglasses and high-heeled beige suede shoes.  Momager Kris, 60, kept her look simple in a black blazer, jeans and trainers and her toyboy boyfriend Corey Gamble, 35, looked laid-back in a grey tracksuit.  Khloe stepped out after returning from a boozy trip to Napa Valley with her mum and sister Kourtney.  The trio shared hilarious videos of their tipsy exploits on Snapchat as they sampled the alcohol.  From a conversation about \"squirting\", to some sexy dancing from Khloe, and then THAT chant/rap from Kris - we saw quite the show from the family members.  In one video Kris was seen looking ahead as she continuously chanted: \"Oh walkie talkie, Oh wa, oh wa, oh walkie talkie.\"  Kourtney shared a snap revealing half drunk glasses of wine with the caption: \"Hungover wine tasting.\"  We bet they had sore heads the next day.  At one point, Kris appeared unable to pronounce the word \"Kindle,\" as Khloe corrected her, saying, \"No, a Kendall is your daughter. Kindle.\"  Later Khloe couldn\\'t resist poking fun at her sister Kylie, as she used a face distortion app to make her lips huge - joking that it\\'s the \"Kylie Jenner filter\".

The iconic Royal Vauxhall Tavern, which featured in last year\\'s hit film Pride about the 1984-5 Miners\\' Strike and where Lily Savage once started a riot, was given Grade II protection.  The 153-year-old pub - one of Britain\\'s most famous gay bars and close to spy agency MI6\\'s headquarters at Vauxhall Cross - has been at the centre of a planning row after being sold to property developers last year.  But the listing will make it much more difficult to close the bar and build flats - and is a victory for the RVT Future campaign.  Founder Amy Lam\u00e9 said: \"The listing is a fantastic milestone for our community and a victory against the odds for our beloved pub.  \"We look forward to continuing our work to ensure the RVT remains a vibrant space of LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) community and culture for generations to come.\"  The pub has a rich and colourful history.  Princess Diana was allegedly disguised as a male model and smuggled into the venue in the late 1980s.

In fact, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge tried to convince everyone that they are still madly in love during their trip to Paris this weekend.  Prince William and Kate Middleton rekindled their shared love of art during a visit to the Musee D\u2019Orsay in Paris. The Duke and Duchess first fell in love while studying art history at St Andrew\u2019s University in Scotland nearly two decades ago.  Eyewitnesses say that art enthusiast Kate Middleton asked lots of questions during their tour of the museum with William by her side. Kate certainly did show the public that she was still angry at her husband as she tried to remain as calm and engaged as possible during their tour. Insiders say that Prince William, meanwhile, looked tired and tense.  Judging from the photos that were snapped, there is some major tension between the Royal couple right now. \\xa0Kate looked absolutely miserable!  There\u2019s a possibility that Kate Middleton is worried that if she does divorce Prince William, she won\u2019t have the same privileged lifestyle that she has now. It\u2019s no secret that the Duchess of Cambridge makes headlines simply because she\u2019s Prince William\u2019s wife. But, if she decides to pull the plug on her royal marriage, Kate\u2019s life won\u2019t be the same.  She won\u2019t be generating publicity for what she wore or how she looked during her public appearances. And, that\u2019s probably what she\u2019ll miss the most. Kate Middleton loves the spotlight but without the royal family, she won\u2019t be in it anymore.  Plus, royal observers know that if Kate Middleton forgives Prince William for his antics drunken antics now, there\u2019s a good chance that she\u2019ll forgive him again and again. In other words, the Duchess is turning a blind eye to her husband\u2019s behavior because she probably doesn\u2019t have any other choice. It\u2019s either this or she goes back to her mother Carole Middleton\u2019s party favor business. Do you agree?

Back in September, Star magazine reported that Angelina was \\'turning to bizarre spiritual rituals in an effort to fix her life and get Brad back\\', but Carrie Kirkpatrick, 51, says she knew that what the actress was doing was very wrong.  \\'When you use spells to try and win someone back, you have to be very careful what you wish for,\\' Carrie told FEMAIL. \\'Brad and Angelina split up for a reason, so if she succeeds in getting back with him, she may end up unhappy.  \\'She is making a foolish mistake if she thinks she can manipulate him back into her life using magic. He has free will. If they are meant to be together, then love and their highest selves will find a way.\\'  Carrie, who is ordained as a Priestess Of the Goddess and teaches people how to connect with the \\'mystical goddess energies\\', also noted how Angelina and Brad had a mutual tattooing session last year, months before their union ended,  It was a symbolic effort to \\'bind their marriage\\', but it failed because she was \\'forcing\\' them to stay together, she said.  Carrie says Angelina has always been interested in the \\'dark arts\\'.  \\'The way she used to wear her ex-husband Billy Bob Thornton\\'s blood in a vial around her neck, this is a form of blood magic,\\' she explained.  \\'It feeds into her tendencies towards BDSM. For her, obsession and possession equal love.\\'  \\'Angelina is known to have a strong interest in the occult, especially Voodoo and Hoodoo.  Carrie has shared a spell for those looking for love at Halloween, but advises that anyone who uses it must have pure intentions. Trying to control someone else\u2019s will, as she believes Angelina is doing with her magic, won\u2019t work.\\xa0 \\'When a person works magic to \"keep\" or \"get\" a particular love interest, it may work, but only for a short period of time,\\' she said.\\xa0 Light the incense, turn down the lights and play the music softly.\\xa0 Anoint the candle with rose or jasmine oil and, focusing on the candle, call upon the Goddess, saying: \\'Great Goddess Hathor, Goddess of Love, of Beauty and Joy, I ask that you be here present this night, that I may voice my true desire for a lover in my life who will lift my heart with passionate joy.\\xa0 May they be guided to my side that we may share a love so true. May our hearts sing with joy in honour of you. Guide me to be in the right place at the right time to meet my heart\u2019s desire, and that they be ready and willing to love me with a passion equal to mine. Show me my new love, O Goddess divine.\\' Now light the candle and place it in the candlestick on a table and say: \\'So mote it be!\\' Then take the handheld mirror and gaze into it. Allow your eyes to lose their focus and, as you look at your reflection, see if another face appears before you. Who is it? Is it someone you already know?\\xa0 Perhaps you will see yourself in a particular situation, look at where you are, taking note of the details. How do you appear? Who else is there? This may be where you meet your lover.\\xa0 When you feel ready, re-focus your eyes and bring your awareness back into the room. Thank Hathor for gifting you the vision and say: \\'Hail and farewell.\\'\\xa0Then let the candle burn all the way down.  \\'Whilst these traditions are not necessarily dark, there is the option here to use the magic for a darker purpose.  \\'In all magic, the choice between working the spell for good or bad is really down to the intention of the practitioner.  \\'It\\'s like opening a very potent toolbox, you can use the tools however you wish, but there will be consequences.  \\'This is why we recommend proper training in magical practice. It\\'s to protect the practitioner as well as the subjects of their magic,\\' said Carrie.  Angelina is also a devotee of tattoos and before she split from Brad, the couple were inked alongside one another by ex Thai monk Ajarn Noo Kanpai, who they flew to Siem Reap in Cambodia in February 2016 to work on the symbolic designs.  She acquired three new mystical sak yant back inkings from the Thai artist, a style which encompasses lines of script, geometric patterns and animal shapes, while Brad had the\\xa0left side of his stomach tattooed with a Buddhist symbol.  The process was meant to \\'symbolically bind them as husband and wife\\', but they ended up splitting in September 2016.  Carrie said: \\'This is a classic case of the magic rebounding, as she was trying to force them to stay together.  \\'She uses her tattoos as protective talismans but they are not linked to witchcraft.  \\'They\\'re magical though, in that she associates them with protective qualities. So she is using the magic of the Far East. This is not witchcraft as we on the West know it - it\\'s the \"magic\" of another culture.\\'  The star also reportedly used magic to woo her man, by presenting him with a vial of grey powder that turned out to be a cremated bat,\\xa0purportedly to ward off negative energies and accidents.  \\'It\\'s more likely that this was intended to bind him to her,\\' Carried explained.  \\'She comes across as a bit insecure so she may have felt that she needed the magic to seal the deal and prevent any other witches or occultists from attacking her or sabotaging her love life.  It\\'s all about the sex with Angelina, and by that I mean the power she can exert over a man. This is like an elixir, the ultimate possession.  \\'She clearly wanted Brad very much and would not consider letting him go. But ultimately, this is a fool\\'s game as there\\'s no point in trying to make someone be with you.  \\'They have free will and entrapping them will only lead to unhappiness. Why would anyone want to be with someone who doesn\\'t want to be with them?\\'  Assisting the lovelorn is one of Carrie\\'s many talents. \\'I\\'ve helped all kinds of people using magic,\\' she says. \\'People with legal issues, love troubles, fears and insecurities.  \\'I guide them through transformation in their lives, by showing them how to face their fears and follow their true path.\\'  When working with people who\\'ve come to her, Carrie has found that some are \u2013 or have been \u2013 witches.  \\'I believe that many people are born witches, and that they have been witches, healers and psychics in previous lives. These people often bring with them a fear of persecution due to the history of so many witches being executed,\\' she claims.  \\'When working with them, it\\'s important for me to help them heal past life trauma so that they can be themselves in this life and do the work that they\\'re destined to do.

Check out Charlize Theron and Sean Penn hanging out at Pharrell Williams\\' shindig below. Chances are their appearance at the gathering will only cause rumors of their rumored romance to spiral completely out of control.  Since Charlize Theron has reportedly found a boyfriend, a close \"friend\" told the folks over at OK! magazine that Keanu Reeves isn\\'t exactly thrilled with the situation. Since he and Theron had an on-again off-again relationship for years, the 47 Ronin star is apparently a little depressed.  \"To see her falling in love with Sean is really hurting him. Charlize and Keanu have been secretly on-and-off for so long. I think he thought they would eventually end up together for good. He\\'s a little heartbroken,\" the insider dished to the publication.  Of course, Charlize Theron\\'s new romance doesn\\'t come without its own set of unique problems. According to Star, yet another anonymous source believes that the actress\\'s mom is very worried that Penn could up and leave at any moment. It goes without saying that no one should take this information as gospel.  \"The South African native if fearful that womanizing Sean will break her daughter\\'s heart.

But this year, fans of the actor were left disappointed when he chose to ignore them and the media while he and the cast of the upcoming superhero film, \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d were at Comic-Con to promote their film, which will hit theaters later this year. Tom Hiddleston\u2019s portrayal of villan, Loki in the comic book superhero movie, \u201cThor\u201d has garnered him legions of fans, mostly female who love his bad boy portrayal of the character.  Although Tom Hiddleston did participate in a panel with the other actors to answer questions about their upcoming film, he chose to skip the the opportunity to take photos with fans or sign autographs. This has left his fans feeling disappointed because some fans actually traveled thousands of miles for the chance to see Tom and get a picture with him.  This is a huge departure from years past, when Tom Hiddleston made it a point to see as many fans as possible. In 2013, while promoting \u201cThor: The Dark World\u201d, Tom surprised and delighted fans by coming to the convention dressed in his full Loki costume. But this year he all but ignored his fans and only briefly appeared on the panel with the other actors and director of the movie, and left the convention as soon as the panel was over.  Audience members also remarked that the usually charming actor didn\u2019t appear too excited to be at Comic-Con, with some of Tom\u2019s own fans commenting that the actor appeared to look sad or unhappy. And it wasn\u2019t just his fans that Tom ignored, he also chose to not speak to the media while at the convention. Besides a few questions from fans and the media during the panel discussion, Tom refused to be interviewed by journalists.  Many believe Tom is still embarrassed by his whirlwind romance with pop star Taylor Swift. Tom and Taylor Swift dated last summer and were heavily criticized for their public displays of affection, including Tom\u2019s decision to wear a tank top declaring his love for the pop star.

For the past few months, Tom has kept a low profile with fans and the media, no doubt in hopes of avoiding questions about his past relationship with Taylor Swift.

And they asked Donald Trump to see if he would be interested to do the show even while running for President.\"  But why is Donald such a hot ticket for the show? \"They would have loved this season to grab him for many reasons especially coming off of a season with his ex Marla Maples being on the show,\" the insider explained. \"But they haven\\'t got a response and always expected a \"No.\" In the producer\\'s eyes it was worth asking.\" Well he hasn\\'t said no yet so there may still be a glimmer of hope!  If there were concerns about no one wanting to dance with Ryan Lochte because of fan backlash, we can\\'t imagine how hard it would be for Donald to find a willing partner. The Republican nominee comes up with a new hateful message each week getting Democrats angrier and angrier at him. However, on Aug. 24 he seemed to be softening his immigration stance on Hannity, so maybe he would do this to become more likable? We\\'ll just have to see when the full cast list comes out!

Last month, the host of The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Strahan sat down for a silly segment.  The two popular TV personalities tackled various topics. The episode was well received, and the millions of people who watched it saw nothing out of the ordinary.  However, according to sources, who spoke to Star, Portia de Rossi\u2019s wife is having what would be considered as buyer\u2019s remorse.  It is being claimed that the host of LIVE did not appreciate DeGeneres\u2019 having her nemesis on the show.  According to the the the publication, Ripa felt betrayed by DeGeneres whom she considered as a friend.  Aware that she got on Ripa\u2019s nerves, DeGeneres has allegedly reached out and apologized for the mistake.  It is not known if Ripa has accepted such apology nor if the ladies have been able to amend their friendship.  The former American football defensive end and Ripa were the co-hosts of Live! with Kelly and Michael from 2012 to 2016.  In spring 2016, he abruptly left the show to join ABC morning television show, Good Morning America.  The ex-athlete was slammed on numerous occasions by Ripa who said she was furious over Strahan\u2019s decision to dump her without warning.  Strahan hit back by stating: \u201cThe most disappointing thing to me was that I was painted as the bad guy because I value the way I carry myself. I do not want people to see me as \u2018Oh, he just ran out, just left them there.\u2019 That is just not true.\u201d  Strahan confirmed that they no longer talk.  In a past interview, he said: \u201cAt one point I think we were friends. I do not know what happened at the end. I learned a lot from her, though.\u201d  He added: \u201cI was not surprised by her reaction at all, but I cannot control somebody else\u2019s actions. I was there four years, and it is about more than just being in front of the camera.\u201d  An article recently appeared on BET, where an insider said Strahan wants to have a sit-down with Ripa.  The source revealed: \u201cMichael is 100% behind meeting with Kelly and clearing the air. These two were TV-husband-and-wife for many years and to go from seeing someone five days a week to having zero contact makes no sense to him. Through mutual friends, Michael has made it clear that he would love to set up drinks or a private meeting with Kelly.\u201d  It is being claimed Ripa has turned him down.

',\n 'Robert Pattinson Finally Has Successful Movie - Twilight Curse Over? | Celeb Dirty Laundry  Robert Pattinson is elated at the success of his upcoming film, \u201cGood Time\u201d. The film premiered at Cannes Film Festival and the movie and actor received a six-minute standing ovation. There is also Oscar buzz surrounding Robert, with some speculating he could receive a Best Actor nomination.  In the gritty, crime film, Robert portrays a criminal named Connie Nikas, who plans a bank heist with his brother. Robert toned down his usually good looks, to the point of being unrecognizable and at one point, he sported shaggy, bleached blonde hair. The star admitted that he was able to shoot scenes in New York without anyone knowing who he was.  When the film premiered recently at Cannes, not only did it receive a standing ovation, there were audible cheers from audience members shouting \u201cBravo\u201d and many came up to Robert to tell him what a great job he had done in the movie. Critics are also raving about the film, which is a departure for Robert, who is used to being ripped by critics and having his films tank at the box office.  Of course everyone knows Robert\u2019s big break came with the 2008 film, \u201cTwilight\u201d where he portrayed broody teenage vampire, Edward Cullen, and continued with the character for a total of four movies. The \u201cTwilight\u201d movies became a billion dollar franchise, making Robert a household name and the object of desire for teenage girls. While he was paid millions to take on the role, it pigeon holed him in Hollywood and almost ruined his career.  For the past few year, Robert has starred in a string of box office duds, including the sappy, coming of age movie, \u201cRemember Me\u201d and mostly forgettable indie films. Some wondered if he would ever see box office success again, while some were quick to blame his faltering career on the \u201cTwilight Curse\u201d.  Since the ending of the \u201cTwilight\u201d and it\u2019s sequels in 2012, most of the young stars from the movie have failed to see further success. Taylor Lautner was supposed to become the next big action star, but after the box office bomb, \u201cAbduction\u201d, he disappeared from Hollywood for years before returning to the small screen with \u201cScream Queens\u201d.  Other actors from the movie franchise, Nikki Reed, Ashley Greene, Kellan Lutz, and Jackson Rathbone have also had trouble finding success after \u201cTwilight\u201d with each having a box office dud and now most are seen only in the occasional straight-to-DVD movie.  Kristen Stewart, who portrayed Bella, has continued to work regularly, although her career suffered a hiccup when it was revealed she had an affair with her married \u201cSnow White and the Huntsman\u201d director.  With the positive buzz surrounding his latest film, I\u2019m sure Robert Pattinson is glad his \u201cTwilight Curse\u201d appears to be over.

In a formal statement, the superstar couple finally confirmed rumours swirling around for days that they were breaking up.  According to the US celebrity website TMZ, Klum, 38, demanded a divorce because she was worried about the effect Seal's was having on their children.     The claim followed reports that she was also fed up with the 48-year-old British singer's 'hard partying.'  There was no suggestion of infidelity, but one source said: 'It was a long time in coming.'     Heidi father Gunther Klum - who had the German model with wife Ema - today spoke out about the breakdown of the couple's\\xa0 marriage.  He told US Weekly magazine: 'We are very sad.'  A statement released by the couple today read: 'While we have enjoyed seven very loving, loyal and happy years of marriage, after much soul-searching we have decided to separate.  'We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart.  'This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition.  'We thank our family, friends, and fans for their kind words of support. And for our children's sake, we appreciate you respecting our privacy.'    at Seal's beachfront home in Mexico in 2005 , Seal and Klum kept their promise to renew their vows every year on their\\xa0 anniversary with their close friends and family.

And the tension in their relationship is believed to have started when the pair holidayed with their three children in Ibiza in August.  A source told the Sunday Mirror: 'They were always the couple everybody strived to be but lately it all started to change. Seal seems to have been partying a lot more often than usual.  'When they had their holiday in Ibiza last summer, Seal hit it hard, was out at clubs and with his friends a lot and Heidi was left with their kids trying to enjoy herself. The cracks were appearing and everybody was talking during that trip. He seemed off the rails.'  The insider added: 'They've spent a lot of time apart too on work assignments and that hasn't helped matters.  'Then when Seal came back to the UK to do promotional work for his next album, he seemed sleepy and not with it on shows like Loose Women, when he was very late for his appearance.'  And a source told The Sun today: 'The marriage ended months ago in reality. They rarely saw each other and it wouldn't be unusual for them to go months without spending any real quality time together. Ships that pass in the night would be an overstatement.'

There\\'s a lot to unpack, which has led to both fans and haters speculating that her upcoming album, Reputation, addresses her side of the story.  From her tumultuous relationship with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, to the name-calling the singer received lately, you don\\'t have to surf for long to get caught up. But her latest single, \"Call It What You Want,\" is a major departure from her last three releases and suggests a different vibe for her forthcoming album \u2014 and a new beauty look to match.  From what we can tell, the overwhelming response to her fourth single is totally positive. Whether she\\'s admitting defeat by apologizing for all the public squabbles that went down last year, or just simply singing about being happy and in love, there\\'s certainly something different here.  The private videos-turned-music video \u2014 at least that\\'s what it looks like to us \u2014 appear to deliver a look at a more grounded, new Taylor. (She did say the \"old Taylor\" was dead, if you recall.) Naturally, this softer side of the star, seen riding horses and painting, comes with a make-under, too. That is: No red lipstick in sight, no \"Shake It Off\" bob and blunt bangs, and we even spotted her natural curls. According to Twitter, this might be the real image Swift is ready to bring back.  Whether you think this is Swift giving us raw honesty and vulnerability or it\\'s a clever move for redemption, it\\'s hard to deny the pattern we\\'ve seen in Hollywood before. Most recently, Miley Cyrus reigned as the queen of the make-under. Alongside her new album Younger Now, Cyrus was featured on multiple magazine covers and her \"Malibu\" music video where her naked face took center stage.  Only time will tell what this new make-under means the star, but were betting there will be a lot less red lipstick in her future.  ',\n 'Fake Pregnancy? Beyonc\u00e9\\'s Twin Baby Bump Is Raising Questions  Beyonc\u00e9 is once again being called out for faking her pregnancy! Radaronline.com had a celebrity Photoshop expert weigh in on the faux double-baby bump.  Everyone went crazy for Beyonc\u00e9\\'s elaborate Instagram pregnancy reveal last week, but some fans were skeptical. They claim that the baby bump is varying sizes and shapes in the photos Bey released.  Despite the critics, Photoshop expert Alan Barry confirmed to Radar that Beyonc\u00e9\\'s bump is real!  \"The baby bump does appear to be real,\" Barry revealed. He did say, however, that other elements of the initial Instagram photo may have been fake. \"The rest of the image is a Photoshopped mash up of a picture of her overplayed on the background of flowers,\" he said.  Even still, it looks like the BeyHive is officially growing by two! ',\n 'Iggy Azalea and Odell Beckham Jr.: Dating!  You might be surprised by the news that Odell Beckham Jr. and Iggy Azalea are dating, but if you stop and think about it for a moment, they actually make perfect sense as a couple.  For one thing, Odell is famous for his one-handed catch, and Iggy is a famous one-hit wonder.  Beckham is forever frustrating defensive backs with his incredible talent, while Azalea frustrates her peers by being an offensive hack with an appalling lack of talent.  The list goes on and on:  Odell is a wide receiver, and Iggy receives widespread criticism for being awful.  Beckham runs hot routes and catches passes, while Azalea received a pass for being a terrible rapper because she\\'s hot.  You get the idea.  Anyway, according to Us Weekly, Beckham and Azalea have finally started admitting that they\\'re a couple.  Rumors that Odell and Iggy are dating first started circulating back in May, but both parties denied they\\'d been hooking up.  \u201cI literally don\u2019t even know Odell Beckham. I don\u2019t,\u201d Azalea told TMZ at the time.  \u201cHe was at my friend\u2019s party and we took a picture with a bunch of people and that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t know him. I\u2019ve not even had a conversation with him.\u201d  Shortly thereafter, however, Iggy admitted that she and Beckham were more than friends, but insisted they had \"a long way to go\u201d to become a couple.  Now, they\\'re finally dating openly, but reps for Azalea are still lying about the relationship for some reason:  \u201cIt\u2019s new, very fresh,\u201d one insider tells Us.  Apparently, we\\'re all supposed to ignore the fact that Iggy and Odell have clearly been dating for like six months.  We can actually see why Iggy would want to keep her love life out of the headlines.  Her last relationship imploded in spectacular fashion when LA Laker Nick Young was caught cheating on Iggy after his teammate uploaded a candid video of Young confessing to infidelity.  Shortly thereafter, Iggy learned that Young, whom she was engaged to at the time, had gotten another woman pregnant.  An experience like that would make anyone want to keep their next relationship on the DL for as long as possible.  For his part, Odell was previously dating model Polyxeni Ferfeli.  Everyone has a type, and apparently, Odell\\'s is super into chicks with ridiculous names.  We wonder is Polyxeni is also a horrendous rapper ...

Anna\\'s now 64 years old, and while she\\'s still got plenty of years to keep running Vogue, her reign isn\\'t going to last forever. Eventually, she will have to find a successor, and according to a report from Radar Online, that successor will be Sarah Jessica Parker.  Now, before you laugh yourself to sleep, listen to Radar\\'s reasoning. Sarah and Anna are friends, and have been friends for a very long time, thanks to the long running popularity of Sex and the City. Vogue owes a huge debt to the show for putting it on the map, especially since the magazine didn\\'t use to be the household name it is now.  Anyway, Radar\\'s source explains, \"Anna is\\xa0worrying colleagues who believe she has found her true successor in Sarah!\\xa0It\\'s a surprising idea, but one that is not entirely a joke. Anna thinks Sarah, a fashion icon on\\xa0Sex and the City, truly has what it takes to step into her shoes and take on a role at\\xa0Vogue\\xa0one day.\\xa0Although Wintour has made no announcements about when she might retire, her scheme to put Parker in the\\xa0Vogue\\xa0pipeline has co-workers shaking in their own designer shoes.\"  You know, the idea\\'s not as far-fetched as it sounds. Sarah\\'s very fashion savvy, and while she doesn\\'t seem like she\\'d be able to run Vogue as well as Anna [who would?], she does have the contacts and image to keep the brand name strong.  What do you guys think? Is Anna Wintour grooming Sarah Jessica Parker to take over Vogue for her? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.

Simpson would reportedly take a paternity test to see if Khloe Kardashian is his daughter, but there\\'s one catch: The reality star would need to visit him in prison.  The former football star, a close friend of late lawyer Robert Kardashian, will consent to a mouth swab but wants the \"Kocktails with Khloe\" starlet to \"show him a little respect\" and stop by the Lovelock Correctional Center in Nevada, according to the Daily Mail Online.  The website cites Jeffrey Felix, a former Lovelock prison guard who claims the facility has given permission for the test, as its source. Felix also penned a book about Simpson called \"Guarding the Juice.\"  \"He wants to talk to her about some other things too, but more importantly like her he wants to know if she is his daughter,\" Felix said.  In the new documentary \"The Man Who Saved O.J. Simpson,\" Felix claimed the 31-year-old Kardashian had begged Simpson to put the paternity question to rest with a test.  Kardashian is the third of four children born to Robert Kardashian, who died of esophageal cancer in 2003, and Kris Jenner, who divorced him in 1991.  The reality star set off ceaseless rumors after speculating on a 2009 episode of \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\" that she might be adopted \u2014 and even swabbed her mom\\'s mouth for a DNA test.  They continued to fend off gossip over Kardashian\\'s paternity, particularly after Robert Kardashian\\'s ex-wives Jan Ashley and Ellen Kardashian, who he married after divorcing Jenner, suggested in a 2012 Star Magazine story that she wasn\\'t a member of the famous family.  Khloe Kardashian got first taste of racism during O.J. trial \"The audacity you have to mention my father\\'s name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a lot of things slide but this one is really low,\" Kardashian, then married to Lamar Odom, tweeted at the time. \"YOU ARE DISGUSTING! (yes you know who YOU are).\"  Jenner later chimed in during a \"Good Morning America\" interview, calling the theory \"crap\" and telling its promoters to \"get a life.\"  \"I was there, right. I gave birth, I know who the dad was. Everything\u2019s good. We\u2019re all good,\" the momager said.  The ex-NFL star was famously acquitted of the murder of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman in the 1995 \"Trial of the Century,\" during which Robert Kardashian served as a member of Simpson\\'s legal dream team.  Jenner, who has admitted she wasn\u2019t faithful to the trial lawyer during their marriage, was a close friend of Brown Simpson.  Not to be licensed for fine art prints or consumer products.

He could be eligible for parole in 2017.  A rep for Kardashian and attorney for Simpson have not yet returned the Daily News\\' requests for comment.   ',\n 'Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Maybe Got Secret-Married Last April  In September, Miley Cyrus told The Sun on Sunday that she and her fianc\u00e9 Liam Hemsworth had no wedding plans anytime soon. \"I don\u2019t envision marriage,\" she told The Sun on Sunday. \"I\u2019m 24. I hope to get to live a little bit more. I have too much living to do [before I get married].\" (Her mother Tish Cyrus made the same point when asked about a rumored Miley-Liam elopement in June, too.)  But, if this wild rumor from Australia\u2019s NW Magazine is true (via The Sun and The Daily Mail), the lack of wedding plans may just be because Cyrus and Hemsworth already had their wedding. In April. A source told the outlet that \"six months ago, way back in late April,\" the two secretly had \"a very intimate ceremony at their house in Malibu. I\\'m told only a handful of people were there and they\\'re still the only ones who know.\" Hm\u2026  Cyrus was first spotted wearing a wedding band-like ring in July.  She was recently photographed with Hemsworth wearing her band with her engagement ring:  Hemsworth was first photographed with one in August.  But People reports these are just promise rings. \"He [Liam] wears that ring as more of a \\'promise\\' to Miley, but they are not officially married,\" a source told E! in August when Hemsworth\\'s ring first debuted. \"The only thing that is missing is the legal piece of paper. The pair is not focused on planning a wedding at this time. They are more focused on making their love as strong as possible.\"  But, given Hemsworth also publicly denied being engaged to Cyrus when Cyrus was probably engaged to him and definitely wearing his engagement ring in April 2016, only those two really know what\u2019s going on.

Bieber shocked millions of fans yesterday when he revealed he was calling off the Purpose tour months before it was due to end as he was \"burned out.\" The Canadian has revealed he wants to get back to his religious roots  He wrote on Facebook that he was was feeling exhausted after 18 long months on the road. However, sources claim Bieber may now be looking at starting up his own church as part of his plan to get closer to God.  \"[He\u2019s] very close to a lot of the Hillsong people. Whether he\u2019s looking at teaming up with them in something of a more permanent situation or doing some sort of religious activity on his own \u2013 starting his own church \u2013 we\u2019re not quite sure, but that\u2019s the word from an inside source.\u201d  A statement on the star\\'s Facebook site read: \u201cDue to unforeseen circumstances, Justin Bieber will cancel the remainder of the Purpose World Tour concerts.  One wrote: \" I\\'m sad, but i understand. I wish nothing but the best for Justin Bieber and hope all is well. I will be at his next tour and will keep him in prayer.\"  While another posted: \"I hope you\\'re okay Justin xxx Your health and wellbeing is more important than the tour.  \"We beliebers support you no matter what. None of us care so much about the tour at the moment ...we care about you and your team. Well done for all the hard work you and the rest of the crew did over the past 18 months Love you xxx\"  Over the last two years, Bieber has admitted he had turned to God as way of getting his life back on the straight and narrow.  In a media interview, the Canadian said that God had come to him when he was lost.  He believed that \"the almighty\" was telling him something.  That was when he decided to change his life for the better and in his own words, \"get his stuff together.\"  And just last month, he took a leap of faith off a cliff in New Zealand, symbolically marking a new chapter in his journey with Christ.  Bieber said the name of \"Jesus\" before launching himself off a cliff at New Zealand\\'s famous Shotover Canyon Swing & Canyon Fox nature reserve.  He fell backwards with closed eyes and hands behind his head.  The video of his fall has reached millions of people. He captioned it #airbaptism and #gracefall.  Bieber was raised in a Christian home but fame and millions of dollars at an early age eroded his relationship with God.  He claims all of that changed when he rededicated his life to Christ and got rebaptised in 2017.  Now he uses his music to express his newfound faith, including singing worship songs at his concerts, and posting pictures of him at church on social media.  BAD BOY From drink-drive arrests to egging houses, Bieber\\'s most outrageous antics Justin Bieber was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, marijuana and prescription drugs. The star had been drag racing a yellow Lamborghini on a Miami beach street with R&B singer Khalil, who had been driving a red Ferrari. Charges were later dropped in an agreement which required Bieber to, among other things, go to anger management counselling and make a large donation to the \u201cOur Kids\u201d organization. Hours after his lawyer filed a not guilty plea to his drunk-driving charge, Justin Bieber was then charged with assault for allegedly hitting a limousine driver repeatedly in the back of the head. The alleged assault occurred when the driver collected six people from a Toronto nightclub on 29 December 2013. However criminal charges against Bieber were late withdrawn. Pilots of a private jet taking Justin Bieber and his entourage to the Super Bowl were forced to wear oxygen masks to protect against inhaling marijuana fumes which were filling the plane. NBC news reported that the captain of the plane was so concerned about the abusive behaviour of Bieber and his father towards a flight attendant that he had to move her away from them. Probably the most famous incident, Bieber was sentenced to two years\u2019 probation and five days community service for egging the house of his neighbour, sports-agent Jeff Schwartz. As well as community service Bieber was also ordered to pay almost $90,000 in damages to his neighbour and undergo anger management counselling. Bieber stormed off stage mid-performance in Manchester after demanding that the crowd stop screaming in between his songs. However the singer did later return to finish his set. The pop star is filmed apparently punching a fan in Barcelona. The fan leaned into Bieber\u2019s moving vehicle to touch him and footage shows Bieber seemingly responding by punching the fan in the face ',\n 'Leonardo DiCaprio Enjoys A Date Night With Kate Winslet For His Birthday \u2014 See The Pics!

However, it was that one very sensitive topic that had the couple upset. As you may know, Kim was robbed of her multi-million dollar, 20-carat engagement ring, at gunpoint in Oct. 2016; as well as other personal items. The traumatic experience caused Kim longterm emotional struggles, which she still deals with to this day.  However, she\u2019s admitted that the robbery was \u201cmeant\u201d to happen to her. \u201cI know this sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me,\u201d Kim said through tears on Ellen [April, 2017]. \u201cI know that was so meant to happen to me. I\u2019m such a different person \u2026 I really feel like things happen in your life to teach you things.\u201d  In case [for some reason] you didn\u2019t watch Taylor\u2019s \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d music video, we can help you decode the whole assumed robbery reference. At one point in the extremely cryptic video, Taylor lays in a bathtub, filled with diamonds.  When Kim was robbed, she said she was attacked in her Paris apartment and taken to the bathroom after she was tied up and gagged.  Then, Taylor makes a gun-notion with her hand and pretends to cock it back with her hands.  Kim was robbed at gunpoint.  Later on in the video, Taylor, along with a group of accomplices, all wearing cat masks and hoodies, are seen viciously tearing through a closet, while stuffing money into bags.  When Kim was robbed, she described the scene as French men rummaging through her things, looking for money, jewelry and other lavish belongings of hers.  So, was Taylor really mocking the traumatic experience Kim endured? You can be the judge of that one. However, we\u2019ve decoded the video [seen above] to give you a clearer look at Tay\u2019s new work.  ',\n \"Is Ryan Seacrest Quitting 'Live'?  Ryan Seacrest is reportedly having a hard time adjusting to life in New York City. The talk show and radio host is renting a place in Manhattan so that he can be in the Big Apple during the week in order to host Live! with Kelly Ripa each morning. However, a new report from Radar Online claims that Seacrest \u2014 who had previously been living in Los Angeles \u2014 is \u201cmiserable\u201d on the East Coast.  \u201cRyan is miserable. [Moving was] the biggest mistake of his life. He hasn\u2019t embraced the city and hasn\u2019t been going out to the restaurants or parties. He\u2019s invited to almost every event every night and doesn\u2019t go! He\u2019s such an LA guy and is finding NYC tough. The weather and the hustle of the city is too much. He can\u2019t wait until the weekends to fly back to his beloved LA,\u201d a source told the popular gossip site.  Although Radar Online doesn\u2019t name a source and has been known to fabricate stories from time to time, this one has some people convinced. It seems more than obvious that Seacrest loved living in Los Angeles and he travels to the West Coast so frequently that one could assume he\u2019s unhappy in New York. He has been rooted in California for years and is used to a different way of life. Moving across the country would be a huge change for anyone, let alone someone famous who has loved that LA lifestyle for so long.  This new report coincides with constant rumors that Seacrest and his Live! co-host, Kelly Ripa, aren\u2019t getting along. Although the two have been pals for many years, sources have said that they are at each other\u2019s throats and that their on-air chemistry (which some fans wouldn\u2019t argue doesn\u2019t even exist) ends the moment the cameras stop rolling.  As previously reported by the Inquisitr, ratings on Live! have dipped since the announcement that Seacrest was the new co-host. However, that dip was almost to be expected, given the hype built up around the announcement, which had been building for a whole year. However, sources have said that Seacrest wasn\u2019t Ripa\u2019s first choice \u2014 and maybe not even her second choice. For fans of Live!, Seacrest wasn\u2019t even in their top five (favorite contenders included Andy Cohen, Anderson Cooper, Fred Savage, Jerry O\u2019Connell, and even Kelly\u2019s husband, Mark Consuelos).  So, if any of these rumors are true, will Seacrest end up leaving Live!? It is definitely a possibility. However, the gig hasn\u2019t seemed right for Seacrest since his name was announced on Monday, May 1. Some fans feel that he wasn\u2019t the best choice to be Ripa\u2019s co-host \u2014 and maybe that\u2019s going to turn out to be true.  There are plenty of rumors out there suggesting that Seacrest is going to leave Live! in 2018. It is entirely possible that he will want to move back to Los Angeles \u2014 and that he may ink a deal to host the new American Idol. That gig has been a part of him for so many years that it almost seems impossible for the show to be successful without him.  Details of Seacrest\u2019s contract with Live! are unknown. He may have signed a one-year deal or he may have signed a multi-year deal. However, there are always ways for someone to get around something if they aren\u2019t happy or it\u2019s not working.  Do you think Seacrest and Ripa are good together? Do you think Seacrest would prefer to move back to Los Angeles and leave morning talk in the past?

While the finalists of The Voice are getting ready to compete for the grand prize, sources on the set revealed that the real completion is in fact between superstar singers Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson!  As fans of The Voice probably already know, last week, the network announced that Hudson and Clarkson, both 35 years old, have signed contracts to join the vocal competition.  However, the two divas quickly clarified that they would not appear on the same season of the hit show!  Reportedly, we will see Hudson on it sooner, as she is set to coach during season 13, while Clarkson will have to wait until season 14 to show herself.  With that being said, one question, in particular, comes to mind \u2013 why can\u2019t they appear on The Voice at the same time?  The answer comes from an on-set source who told us that \u201cKelly and Jennifer really cannot stand each other!\u201d  \u201cKelly was completely blindsided when she saw that Jennifer was cast because no one had told her about it,\u201d the insider added.  But even though Hudson and Clarkson are not going to meet on the show, after all, that doesn\u2019t mean the set is safe from the drama.  Considering that Miley Cyrus is set to return for Season 13, the insider revealed that pretty much everyone hopes for some \u201ccattiness\u201d between her and Jennifer Hudson.  \u201cIt would be so great!\u201d  What do you think of Jennifer Hudson being added as a vocal coach for season 13? Was she the right choice?  Cruise down to the comment section down below and tell us what your thoughts! ',\n 'Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake on the brink of divorce  The American magazine OK! announced the five-year-marriage has come to an end  Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel have decided to go separate ways.  According to the American paper, this could be one of the most expensive divorces from the industry, considering the pair possesses a $300 million fortune.  Apparently, their marriage started to crumble because the conflicts related to their child, careers and Justin\u2019s \u201cother woman\u201d multiplied.  Last month, Jessica attended the Emmy\u2019s Awards Gala alone, looking sad and weak.  According to sources inside their entourage, the situation is the same for months now.  The Emmy Gala was a pretty big deal for Jessica and they usually support each other when it comes to such things.  The fact that Justin refused to be with her proves their relation has deteriorated.  It seems that Justin was on the night of the gala in Brazil, where he performed in a concert, but Biel was obviously bothered by his reaction because he didn\u2019t make any effort.  \u201cJess feels many times as if she is a single mother and became tired of this. She does not trust him anymore\u201d, revealed a source for OK!, stating that Biel and Justin are also fighting because he is cheating on her.  American singer and actor Justin Timberlake married actress Jessica Biel on October 19, 2012 in southern Italy, after a five-year relationship that began in 2007.  The two artists got engaged on Christmas 2011 and they have a son, Silas Randall Timberlake, who is now two years old. ',\n 'BRAD PITT : No Doubt, TRUMP Will Be The Best President In U.S History.

Sources said Griffin had expected CNN \u201cgolden boy\u201d Cooper to stand by her, but the news network swiftly announced she was fired from the NYE broadcast with Cooper, which they\u2019ve done together for 10 years.  TV insiders say respected newsman Cooper had no choice but to condemn Griffin\u2019s disturbing photoshoot, in which she held up a faux severed and bloody head of President Trump.  After the controversial image of Griffin went viral, sparking widespread backlash, Cooper tweeted, \u201cFor the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.\u201d  But a source said, \u201cKathy totally misjudged this. She truly believed that Anderson would stick up for her. She considered him a friend. While she has nobody to blame but herself, she feels somehow betrayed.\u201d Griffin appeared in a tearful press conference Friday where she sobbed of Trump: \u201cHe broke me.\u201d No word about Cooper.  The buzz at CNN is that Cooper could use the opportunity of Griffin\u2019s firing to bring his longtime buddy, Bravo\u2019s \u201cWatch What Happens Live\u201d star Andy Cohen, into his NYE broadcast. Cohen also hosts \u201cLove Connection\u201d on Fox.  The source said, \u201cAnderson wants Andy to co-host with him. They are already doing a multi-city tour together, they are besties and have a great rapport.\u201d Cohen revealed that they were set up on a blind date in the early \u201990s, but Cooper says Cohen blew it during their initial phone call by being \u201ctoo enthusiastic.\u201d They were later introduced by mutual friends in LA and their platonic bromance blossomed.  But sources add that Cohen \u201cmay have some contractual problems to overcome\u201d with Bravo before he can appear on CNN with Cooper.  Reps for Bravo, Cohen and CNN declined to comment.

Bey, that is!  \"Beyonce was filming a video and Hillary made a surprise visit to the set\" on Thursday, March 24, in L.A., a source exclusively reveals in the latest issue of Us Weekly.  The insider could not reveal if the Democratic front-runner, 68, scored an on-screen cameo, but a second insider confirms Beyonce, 34, is currently working on an album, complete with music videos. (The album is likely to drop in April.)  By the next morning, Clinton had returned to the campaign trail, setting her sights on the goal she laid out in December.    \"I want to be as good a president as Beyonce is a performer,\" she said when asked at an Iowa town hall if she\\'d rather be Beyonce or president.  No doubt securing a permanent spot in the hive, the presidential hopeful had high praise for the pop star at the event: \"You see her on TV, it\\'s impressive; you see her in person, you\\'re just stunned. Thinking like, \\'How does she do that?\\' Really. I mean, she\\'s singing, she\\'s up and she\\'s down. She\\'s just amazing.\"  The admiration is mutual. Last May, Beyonce attended a Hillary Clinton fundraiser event in NYC.

But that assessment might actually be spot on - Kendall\\'s reportedly causing so much tension within 1D that the boys\\' arguments are actually getting physical! \"The other day, Harry and Niall [Horan] almost came to blows when Niall confronted Harry when he showed up late for a meeting,\" the same source said. \"Things got out of hand before\\xa0Zayn\\xa0[Malik] stepped in to break them up.\"  Guys!

I\u2019m no longer interested in the daily facade. I\u2019ve put everything I know into these paintings.\u201d  Carrey first met Donald Trump at a boxing match held at the\\xa0Trump Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City in the early 90s. A popular TV actor at the time, Carrey was criticized by Trump\u2019s associates for \u201cfailing to entertain\u201d the future president.  But according to Carrey, he was \u201cavoiding him like the plague\u201d because he witnessed Trump shapeshifting when he arrived at the venue.  \u201cDonald Trump has a long reptile face, an oversized beak, and his scales are a disgusting grey color, like sewer water,\u201d Carrey said.  Explaining that Donald Trump shapeshifted between this state and his human form \u201cat least three times\u201d while greeting him, Carrey claims that he also saw Trump shapeshifting while greeting other celebrity guests.  \u201cHis hands turned into scaly reptile hands while he gesticulated at random acquired objects he deemed beautiful or valuable.

The gatekeepers will try to deny I said these things. When that doesn\u2019t work, they will try and destroy my reputation.\u201d  Carrey also told his fans and supporters to \u201clook deeply\u201d at his artworks to \u201cdecipher their real meaning.\u201d  \u201cThere are some things you can\u2019t say, but you can paint. I have put everything I know into those paintings.\u201c  \u201cIt\u2019s 1am, I\u2019m eating goldfish and talking about reptilianism with new friends.

Carrey\u2019s first hand experiences with the reptilian-Illuminati chime with my own research and second hand accounts.\\xa0 I have dedicated the last five years to researching the elusive, tyrannical powers that rule our world, travelling to over 80 countries, and it never ceases to amaze me how many people from very different walks of life have told me stories about seeing \u2018people\u2019 briefly turn into reptilians before their very eyes.

She quickly grabs a lunch to go and leaves.\"  The source also claims Jen, 44, has fancier transportation than everyone else - as well as a trailer that is much farther away from the set than anybody else\\'s.  \"All the actors ride in normal production vans when they head to lunch, but Jen has her own luxury SUV,\" the source said.  \"And not only is Jen\\'s private trailer miles away from the set, but she heads all the way back there each day to eat her lunch away from everyone else.\"  The source concluded by telling RadarOnline.com that Jen isn\\'t outwardly rude to anyone on set, but that she just acts like a diva and it\\'s off-putting to those around her.  \"Her behavior is a clear indicator to everyone that she\\'s not approachable,\" the source said.  \"And it\\'s just unnecessary. There\\'s no reason why she has to act any better than anyone else on that movie set.\" ',\n 'Warner Bros. FINALLY Planning \u2018 Gossip Girl \u2019 The Movie!

',\n 'Robert Pattinson Recovering From Alleged Drinking Problem - Realized Substance Abuse Would Tank Career! | Celeb Dirty Laundry  According to recent reports and hints dropped by Hollywood sources, Robert Pattinson may have had a secret drinking problem that no one knew about. It would certainly explain why he\\'s been hanging out with Zac Efron, of all people. We already know Zac isn\\'t known for his sobriety, and Rob has been partying quite a lot lately.  Star Magazine\\'s source claims, \"Rob had a hard time adjusting to fame and his breakup with\\xa0Kristen [Stewart], and he turned to alcohol to numb it all.\\xa0He drank a lot every night, and even during filming. But his health was suffering, and he realized his reputation for drinking could cost him plum roles.\"  Is this so hard to believe? Daniel Radcliffe notably had a drinking problem as well, and that was without the public infamy that came with his girlfriend cheating on him in front of the whole world. Clearly, something about all these YA franchises is causing its actors to turn to alcohol, but with Rob\\'s situation, he\\'s always been a social drinker \u2013 maybe a little too much.  He\\'s admitted to drinking before auditions, and he\\'s usually photographed at bars or parties these days. Even if his vice isn\\'t alcohol, plenty of people have said that Rob\\'s had an issue with substance abuse, even if these allegations haven\\'t technically been proven yet.  And trust me, they won\\'t be. Rob\\'s people are very loyal to him and very protective of him, and they won\\'t go to the press with this. And if Star\\'s source is right, then he\\'s already realized that his health and appearance are more important, especially if he wants to continue acting. Alcohol doesn\\'t do the best things to people\\'s faces or bodies, and it\\'s not like Rob has the acting skills to keep him employed without his looks. Sorry Twi-hards, but you know it\\'s true.

Jen\\'s having the last laugh. She loves the fact she has become his confidante.\"  Exactly how Brad won over Jen as a friend is no real mystery. Earlier this year, he revealed his excessive binge-drinking to GQ \u2014 \"I was boozing too much,\" he said at the time \u2014 and has since decided to quit drinking and issue apologies to all those he wronged. Seeing as Jen \"was the person highest on his apology list,\" as the source says, he called her last June and offered his sincere regrets.  \"Brad flat-out apologized for all the heartache and pain he caused by leaving her for Angelina,\" the source continues. \"He came off as genuinely sorry and Jen was deeply touched. She was completely won over.\"  One more in-depth conversation was all it took to cement their friendship. Brad opened up to Jen about the infamous plane incident last year in which he allegedly got physical with Maddox while intoxicated. He also got candid about the custody battle that\\'s still ranging on present-day.  Brad Pitt Jennifer Aniston Getty Images (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  \"He soberly spoke about hitting rock bottom,\" the source says, \"and how he made the climb out. He launched into a grand apology. He apologized for being an absentee husband in the marriage \u2014 being stoned and bored much of the time. He also made amends for being an avoider, getting lost and in a serious drinking-and-getting-high phase when he fell for Angelina while making Mr. & Mrs. Smith.\"  The conversations re-instilled Jen\\'s faith in Brad\\'s sensitivity. In 2005, she infamously remarked that Brad was missing \"a sensitivity chip.\" But it seems with these recent, heart-felt dialogues, his chip has been restored in Jen\\'s eyes.  \"He told Jen they might still even be married if he were emotionally and physically present and sober at the time,\" the source says. \"It was the most intimate conversation Brad had ever had with Jen.\"  The rekindled friendship could even spark some future collaboration. \"Brad wants her involved again,\" says the source, \"and Jen wants in on such prestige projects.\"  \"Jen has a way of calming and encouraging Brad, which he needs in his hectic life right now,\" the source continues. \"He\\'s in a great place mentally and physically. He\\'s in touch with his emotions and his true self like never before. He is closer to the kids than he has been in months, and he\\'s shown tremendous maturity and patience with Angelina concerning the divorce.\" ',\n 'Kendall Jenner Wants to Break Free From the Kardashian Clan  Kendall Jenner is ready to move on from her famous family!

',\n 'Leah Remini Opens Up About Her Friendship With Jennifer Lopez And The Scientology Connection  Jennifer Lopez and ex-Scientologist Leah Remini are the best of friends. They have known each other for several years and have been through a lot. Come what may, their friendship weathers through. It has always seemed that Leah was the only one with a Church of Scientology connection, but that isn\u2019t the case.  In a recent interview with People, Leah Remini shared how her friend Jennifer Lopez fits into the Scientology equation. While Jennifer isn\u2019t a member of the Church of Scientology herself, her father David is. He has been in the church for over 30 years. When Leah left the Church of Scientology, she was lucky that her husband Angelo Pagan, her daughter Sofia, and her mother Vicky all came with her. A topic she has covered on her A&E Emmy-nominated show, Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, is \u201cdisconnecting.\u201d  When a member of the Church of Scientology decides to leave the religion, their friends and family that are still in the church are no longer to have contact with them. This is called disconnecting. Now, while the church\u2019s rebuttal is that no one is forced to disconnect and that it is a choice, viewers of her show understand how serious disconnection is taken.  Leah shared that actually, her friend Jennifer Lopez could be in danger of disconnection for remaining her friend. The way the Church of Scientology believes, David Lopez, being an active member, should disconnect from Jennifer because of her continuing connection to Leah. She did imply that it is enforced more for members who are not such \u201cbig names.\u201d Considering she left the Church of Scientology in 2013, it appears there have been no repercussions for their friendship.  The Church of Scientology took offense to her observations and responded by bashing Leah\u2019s show where she takes on the church. The few times the church has responded to Leah Remini, it has always been to refute all claims their ex-believer has made. They say she is lying, staging the show, and all other ex-members who are on her show are just as dishonest. Leah remains dedicated to exposing the church and the leaders.

James Wan started filming for Aquaman in Australia last month. While Jason Momoa and Mera actress Amber Heard have already shot their first scene together, Queen Atlanna actress Nicole Kidman\\xa0reached a few days ago. Following her landing, there have reportedly been feud sparks on the sets.  The actress, who will be seen playing Momoa\\'s mother in the movie, recently shared that she was excited to take on the role of the female warrior,\\xa0but it looks like she does not like Heard\\'s presence on the sets.  Also Read: Is something brewing between Aquaman Jason Momoa & Nicole Kidman on sets of DC movie?  According to a report by National Enquirer, it seems like there is an epic clash in making. The report claims that Kidman is not treating Heard like others on the set. The website\\'s source shares that she has been giving Heard a cold treatment since the pre-production stage. But why?  National Enquirer claims that it has to do with Heard\\'s divorce with Kidman\\'s dear friend Johnny Depp. \"Nicole didn\\'t like how Amber treated [her friend] Johnny Depp during their divorce,\" the source told the outlet.  \"It doesn\\'t help that [Kidman] has little respect for Amber as an actress,\" or that her role in the movie is \"bigger\" than Kidman\\'s. \"She thinks Amber\\'s getting by on social climbing and good looks rather than talent,\" adds the report. The website\\'s source also added that Heard\\'s \"forceful personality\" will \"guaranteed snap\" when Kidman arrives on set.  However, Gossip Cop\\'s shares that there is no truth in these claims. Debunking the bogus claim, the website assures that the news is indeed fake.  The gossip website reached out to the Big Little Lies star and her rep guaranteed that there is no truth in the made claims. They also write that another source from the Aquaman movie sets shares with them that there are no issues between the two actresses.  While that has ended the possible speculations, new video shared by Heard show how much she is working out and preparing for her scenes in the movie. In a boomerang video she shared on Instagram, the actress is seen cart-wheeling with her trainer on the sets.  Whereas, Jason Momoa is busy rock climbing as he shares more videos from his training camp.

That\\'s the way I\\'d put it best, I think.\" You think?  \"I think that the funny thing is, [Harry] would say the same thing about me because he doesn\\'t really listen to hip-hop music, whereas it\\'s like my song\\'s more \u2018Rack City\\' and his song is more of a different era to something I\\'d listen to, I guess.\"  Fair enough, Liam, and thank you for the clarification.

The reason why Madonna\\'s son Rocco bolted for his father\\'s home is becoming clearer. It seems that Madonna is a bit more strict at home than one would imagine, and she wants to send son Rocco to military school. Rocco Ritchie, 15, does not want to go, and while on tour with Madonna, he ran off to live with his father.  According to the Inquisitr, Madonna says that Guy Ritchie is trash-talking her to Rocco, but Rocco insists that his mother is controlling and uses him as a trophy. Also, rather than being in school in New York, he is dragged along on her tour and put to work. He has had enough and wants to live with his father. This is a struggle that many divorced parents face, but Madonna feels that she is above this and went right to a judge, but Rocco is refusing to come back to the U.S.  Radar Online is reporting that Madonna is taking her controlling manner to a new level by trying to get Rocco into military school.  \"Madonna is a very good mother, but she\\'s mega controlling,\" a source close to the pop icon, 57, told Radar. \"She actively tells him what he can and can\\'t do, who he can and can\\'t talk to.\"  But Madonna thinks that military school will straighten Rocco out, but Rocco wants a normal life with Guy Ritchie in the U.K.  \"He\\'s not being dragged around like a dancing puppet [when he\\'s in London],\" a source told the publication. \"He can meet his friends, eat fast food, he doesn\\'t have an early curfew. The story is his father manipulated him, which couldn\\'t be farther from the truth. Rocco has a life and friends [in the U.K.] and he can have girlfriends and be in one place.\"  The judge had ruled that Rocco should be back by Christmas but is now insisting that he is back before school starts in January  The New York Daily News has mentioned that Madonna is a meddling mama, and Rocco is over it. A source says that life in London is easier for Rocco at this point in his life.  Madonna thinks she can provide a better life for Rocco, and that Guy Ritchie\\'s life is boring.  \"(Madonna) is impossible to work with and impossible to live with for a 15-year-old boy. He has no freedom under her. She tells him he\\'s going away to school,\" says the source. \"His life (in London) is not strict, he\\'s not Madonna\\'s son, he\\'s more like a regular teen. Guy lives a very normal life, Rocco is not on movie sets, if he doesn\\'t want to be there.\"  Rocco desperately wants to enroll in school in London and come back to New York in the future to visit. Over the weekend, Rocco was seen skateboarding around the Ritchie neighborhood and simply hanging out with friends.  There is no indication whether Rocco plans to return to New York for a hearing with the judge or if he will fight it from London with his father.  Do you think it would be best if Madonna would just give Rocco time with his father?

The power couple was on the way to the Saving SPOT! fund-raiser at Tiato in Santa Monica when they got into an argument and turned around without attending the event, even though they were listed and pictured on the invitation as hosts. Ellen and Portia on Monday insisted to Page Six they had informed the charity they would be unable to make it and their picture should not have been on the invitation.  A source told us: \"Ellen and Portia were supposed to be at the event at 5 p.m., but at 6:30 p.m., the media was still waiting for their arrival.

Ellen and Portia attended last year\\'s benefit in Beverly Hills and had been happy to be listed as hosts for this year\\'s event, we\\'re told.  Ellen - a generous animal-welfare supporter - and Portia said in a statement to Page Six: \"We were happy to lend our names as honorary chairs and the organization was always aware that we would be unable to attend. This is the first time we have seen our images attached to the invite. It was not approved and it is misleading.\"  DeGeneres\\' attorney Marty Singer said, \"The story is a complete lie. My client told the organizer they never agreed nor planned to attend the event. There was no fight that caused them not to attend.\" The charity didn\\'t respond to requests for comment.  Ellen recently slammed divorce rumors and reports of arguments on the season premiere of her talk show. \"I had a great summer,\" she said in September. \"I went on a trip with Portia, my beautiful wife - who I am happily married to, but thank you for your heartfelt concern, tabloids.\" ',\n \"Dream Scenario?

Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian\u2019s wedding was one to remember for sure, and Kim Kardashian was also there. But as we\u2019ve learned, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians celeb has trouble staying away from social media for too long.  One source present at the Beauty and the Beast themed ceremony revealed that Kanye\u2019s wife was reprimanded not once but twice for breaking the tennis champion\u2019s no-phone rule.

As fans of the sportswoman may already know, Williams and Ohanian made sure to invite Vogue editor Anna Wintour at the wedding as one of the honor guests.  Of course, the ultimate goal was to keep all of the pictures away from the press so they could give Vogue the exclusive rights to publish them later.

He\u2019s even supposedly considering settling down with Selena in the future. Of course, before he could even consider getting down on one knee, Selena needs to convince her family and friends that he\u2019s legit.

Justin Bieber happily made a joke at his own expense after stepping out with a big wet patch on his pants the day before.  The 23-year-old shared an Instagram of himself and Adam Sandler's character Billy Madison on Thursday to 'fess' up to peeing in his pants.  Just a few hours after pictures of the star surfaced of him with an unfortunate stain on his crotch area, Justin posted a picture of himself next to a screen grab from the movie Billy Madison.  Using a quote from a scene in the 1995 movie, Justin captioned the side-by-side image: 'You ain't cool unless you pee your pants.'  In the popular comedy, Adam's character - an adult man force to return to school to prove he can run his father's business - pretends to pee his pants so that one of his school friends does not get made fun of for actually peeing his pants.  The pee or not pee drama all started after the 24-year-old was seen in West Hollywood, California, with a giant wet patch on the front of his sweats.  The Sorry star's stain covered his entire crotch area and was rather visible in his almost $700 grey Vetements sweatpants.  The star ignored both the wet patch and a cameraman who constantly asked him about his ex Selena Gomez's new relationship with The Weeknd.  Justin made a beeline for his matte black Range Rover which he has had the badge changed on so it says Stealth Rover.  While in too much of a hurry to check his crotch area, Justin was not in too much of a hurry to grab a healthy juice.  Obviously unperturbed by walking around in wet pants, the platinum blond singer then headed to Earthbar.  There he fueled up on a green juice and walked along one of the area's busiest streets without a wet patch care in the world.  Aside from his stained designer sweatpants, Justin wore a white T-shirt with a distressed grey jean jacket and a pair of Nike Air Huarache.  As is his style these days, the Baby hitmaker added a pair of clear lens glasses.  Justin did ditch his stained pants later to head to church late that night.  It was fortunate he opted for jeans, as rumored on and off again love interest Kourtney Kardashian was also there.

The Les Miserables star allegedly submitted a long list of demands before agreeing to attend the Pink Party Gala in Santa Monica on October 19.  A source told In Touch magazine that the Oscar-winner\\'s team were \"really concerned\" she would be bombarded by fans for photos and autographs at the event, and an email was sent to staff with a series of strict guidelines.  The insider added: \"Everyone was asked not to talk to her.\"  The email, obtained by gossip website RadarOnline.com, also noted that other stars, who attended made no such demands.  The staff email stated: \"I know in the past our hosts have mingled in the party, but each person is different. We are trying to respect her space.\"  A source also claimed that even though staff adhered to Anne\\'s list of demands, the actress was very unfriendly.  The source said: \"She was so rude and acted like a b***h to a few people she did speak to. She just sat there rolling her eyes all night.\"  Anne, 30, also attended the Victory Fund Champagne Brunch in Beverly Hills with her husband, Adam Shulman, on October 20, where she broke down in tears as she took to the stage to introduce cancer specialist Dr. Beth Karlan, who recently helped her friend beat the disease.

Finally addressing rumors that have circulated for years, legendary director John Frankenheimer admitted he had a one-night stand with the adopted Bay\\'s birth mother, who claimed he was Bay\\'s dad \u2013 and that he paid her off.  But Frankenheimer denied \"absolutely, categorically\" that he is the younger director\\'s father.  \"We had tests done, and I am not his father,\" Frankenheimer told the Los Angeles Times in an interview published yesterday.  Bay, 37, who\\'s in Honolulu for the premiere of \"Pearl Harbor,\" declined to respond to the bombshell revelation.  \"It\\'s a private matter,\" Bay said of the story \u2013 which Frankenheimer, 71, unleashed just five days before the release of \"Pearl Harbor,\" one of the summer\\'s most highly anticipated movies.  The older director said his \"one-night stand\" with Bay\\'s birth mom \u2013 who was not identified \u2013 happened at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel while he was making \"Seven Days in May\" in 1963.  Months later, Frankenheimer got a call from his lawyer, the late Frank Wells, who said the woman was pregnant \u2013 and had named Frankenheimer as the father.  \"I asked Wells, \\'What can we do?\\'\" said Frankenheimer, who feared a scandal would hurt his career. \"We can pay her off,\" the director quoted Wells as advising him. So Frankenheimer paid the mother $7,500, and says he \"didn\\'t hear anything more about this\" until 16 years ago.  By the mid-1980s, Bay, adopted and raised by Jimmy and Harriet Bay in L.A.\\'s Westwood section, was an aspiring filmmaker trying to find his birth parents.  \"I [did] a little investigation,\" Bay told the Times. \"I found [my mom] in three days.\"  Then Frankenheimer got a call from the woman\\'s lawyer.  \"He said there is a young man at Wesleyan University, and he wants to find out who his real parents are,\" Frankenheimer recalled.

',\n 'Prince William and Kate Middleton Moving Out Of Kensington Palace? | Celeb Dirty Laundry  Prince William and Kate Middleton are already thinking about moving out of Kensington Palace. That\u2019s because William doesn\u2019t want his children Prince George and Princess Charlotte to grow up behind palace walls. Instead, he wants them to live a life out of the spotlight and as far away from the paparazzi as possible.  In his interview with British GQ, Prince William said that the most important thing for him is knowing that Prince George and Princess Charlotte will grow up in a happy, stable secure world.  In other words, he doesn\u2019t want his kids to experience the same royal hustle and bustle that he had while growing up behind closed doors. And while Prince William and Kate Middleton haven\u2019t fully moved in to Kensington Palace just yet, they are already thinking about their next move. Apparently, London is the last place that William wants to be with Kate and their kids.  Of course, if Prince William and Kate Middleton do end up moving from Kensington Palace, royal observers wouldn\u2019t be surprised. It\u2019s taken them this long to move back to London after having spent the last several years at Anmer Hall. Prince William has made it no secret that he doesn\u2019t want his children to have the same childhood he had while growing up.  Ideally, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would love to move back to Anmer Hall. It was a gift given to them by Queen Elizabeth. The property boasts a swimming pool and private tennis court and enough room for Prince George and Princess Charlotte to run around in all day and night.  But of course for Prince William this won\u2019t be easy. He can try and live a private life as much as he wants to, but at the same time he is the future King of England. Prince George and Princess Charlotte are going to be in the spotlight whether he likes it or not. And as much as he would love to return to Anmer Hall in the future, it might not happen.  All of his royal responsibilities and engagements are in London. That\u2019s why many royal fans believe that sooner or later William will just have to suck up his feelings and do the job he was born to do.  In the meantime, don\u2019t forget to check back with CDL for all the latest news and updates on the royal family right here! ',\n \"Brad Pitt Texts Jennifer Aniston Nonstop: Seeks Intense Emotional Support After Angelina Jolie Divorce! | Celeb Dirty Laundry  Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston have reportedly gotten back in touch through texting, even though sources from both sides are falling over themselves to clarify that it's 'just texting' and not anything more serious.  Oh, Jen. She's probably so happy inside, even though she would never admit it for fear of coming across as petty. Think about it \u2013 this is the same man who humiliated her by dumping her for another woman, and now he's the single one while she's happily (or seemingly happily) married. AND he's texting her! It's all her dreams coming true.  Anyway, sources claim that Jennifer and Brad have been casually texting over the past few days, and Brad has been discussing how difficult the divorce has been for him. Apparently, Jennifer has been helping him through this, which is a little suspicious. Being magnanimous, fine, but offering support and advice to an ex-husband that you spent more than a decade getting over? Um... no.  It's been several months since Angelina Jolie filed for divorce and took their kids with her, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that Brad Pitt has been having a tough time since then. He's withdrawn from the spotlight, and we probably wouldn't have seen or heard from him at all if it were not for the fact that he produced Moonlight, one of the most visible films on this year's awards circuit and the eventual winner of this year's Best Picture Oscar.  Regardless, for whatever reasons, Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston are back in touch \u2013 and how does Angelina Jolie feel about this? Well, apparently, not very happy. Again, not much of a surprise. Angelina may have been the one to call it quits, but that doesn't mean that she's over her ex-husband, the same way he's not over her.  She didn't leave because she fell out of love with him, she left because of his 'issues', whatever those issues were. And now, to hear that he's talking with his ex-wife, the woman that he left for her? Let's just say \u2013 if Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie weren't already broken up, that might have done the trick.  What do you guys think of Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston texting again, and do you think Angelina Jolie is jealous about it? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below. \",\n 'Is Leonardo DiCaprio losing interest in love life amid midlife crisis?

But it seems that Kim Kardashian's rush to regain her svelte frame has had an unwanted effect on her hair.     Images of the 33-year-old with her hair tied up in a high bun while out in Los Angeles last week show the extent of what appears to be extreme hair loss, which the reality star seems to have been attempting to cover up with weaves and hair extensions.  And according to hair extension expert Tatiana Karelina, it could be Kim's rapid weight loss that triggered her hair loss.     Tatiana told MailOnline: 'It is well known that during the later stage of pregnancy you lose less hair due to hormones, making it thicker and lusher, but when you have the baby most women find they\\xa0 seem to be losing a lot more hair than normal.  'What with the rapid amount of weight Kim lost and dieting in the months after the birth, this may have accelerated the hair loss, giving sparser looking patches, we can clearly see how thin her hair is around the hairline.     Thinning out: Hair extension expert Tatiana Karelina told MailOnline that Kim's rapid post-pregnancy weight loss could have contributed to her thinning locks   Where the real ends and the fake begins: The line of Kim's extensions could clearly be seen During pregnancy: Kim showed no signs of any hair loss as she was pictured with her hair scraped back into a ponytail back last May 'Birth and rapid weightloss are both factors that have triggered her thinning hair and made her opt for hair extensions to boost her diminished hair volume.' Tatiana added that Kim's apparent reliance on hair extensions to give her boosted locks have now left her with Traction Alopecia, and that she should have the weaves removed as soon as possible if she doesn't want to damage her hair further.    She told MailOnline: 'In spite of giving instant full thick hair, weaves put extreme pressure on the hair and scalp, often too heavy and tight, the pulling and weight often cause severe migraines and Traction Alopecia, and actually aid hair loss rather than help to recover healthy hair regrowth. Top knot trouble: Kim displayed the hair loss as she wore her hair up in a high bun while out in Los Angeles last week    'I would not recommend that Kim keep the weave in her hair, but rather opt for lighter non damaging types of extensions, or a simple clip-in that can be taken out often to relieve pressure on hair follicles and the scalp.'  Kim isn't the only star to have suffered after relying on extensions and weaves.  Rihanna and Naomi Campbell are among the other famous faces to have found themselves with damaged hair after boosting their barnets with extensions. \",\n \"Tyra Banks Sued for Causing 'Emotional Distress' During \u2018America\u2019s Got Talent\u2019 Taping  *A contestant on \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d says\\xa0her performance at a recent taping was roasted\\xa0so viciously by\\xa0new host Tyra Banks\\xa0that it has caused emotional distress to her young daughter, who was watching from the wings.  The woman, identified in the filing as Jane Doe, filed a lawsuit against Banks on Tuesday in L.A. Superior Court accusing the former model\\xa0of battery and assault, and seeking\\xa0damages for infliction of emotional distress, reports Variety.  Jane Doe says she and her husband were performing an ode to their\\xa0daughter, identified as Mary, during\\xa0a taping on March 19. Once they finished, the woman says that she and her husband were \u201chumiliated\u201d by the judges and the audience, who criticized the song.  According to the suit, Banks added to the humiliation by making fun of the song in front of Mary. Jane Doe alleges that Banks pulled her daughter\u2019s hair back, physically manipulated her, and insinuated that the girl was accidentally conceived.  Afterward, \u201cMary was traumatized and became deeply depressed,\u201d the suit states. \u201cMary would become extremely nervous and anxious whenever, among other triggering events, she hears any mentions of [the] song and [the] song itself, whenever she ruminates about the events during or related to the performance, and whenever she thinks about the prospective televised airing or use online of Jane Doe and her husband, their performance, as well as the airing and use online of any footages of Mary.\u201d  Reality show contestants typically sign waivers acknowledging that they may be subjected to ridicule and humiliation. However, the suit alleges that Marathon Productions got Mary to sign a contract without her parents\u2019 knowledge or consent, according to Variety.  After the contestant complained, the company communicated that it would not feature Mary in the broadcast. However, the couple asked that the entire performance not be aired. That request was refused. \",\n 'JENNIFER ANISTON HINTS AT FRIENDS REUNION  Jennifer Aniston is making Friends fans very happy!

Latifah Brown called 911 around 9:30 PM last night, reporting that she had a baby stuck in her vagina. The operator first assumed that she was giving birth at home and dispatched an ambulance to the site. The paramedics had quite a surprise when they arrived on the site and saw what was actually happening. One of the paramedics, Brian Whitmore, related the incident in an interview with WBNS-10 TV. The little boy wore a diaper and pyjamas, but he had his legs and abdomen stuck in the womans vagina. The paramedics spent more than an hour on the site trying to release the child from his difficult position but were unable to get the toddler out. I dont know how she got the child in there! We were both pulling as strong as we could and he wouldnt come out. Ms. Brown and the child were finally transported to the hospital, where doctors were able to separate them after a delicate operation. The young boy suffers from a dislocated hip, but doctors dont think he will suffer any sequelae from the incident. The babysitter was interrogated by police and confessed to deliberately inserting the child in her vaginal cavity. She explained that she was feeling depressed after her doctor told her she could never have children and wanted to know how it felt to give birth. Ms. Brown now faces a total of 11 criminal charges, including aggravated child neglect causing bodily harm, and could spend up to 65 years in prison.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation suspected 54-year old Dave Murray, an employee of the Harris County Morgue, of being implicated in an organ trafficking network. Investigating several reports of missing organs and body parts, dozens of agents raided his residence this morning, hoping to find evidence of his involvement in the crimes. What they found on the site was a lot more disturbing than what they expected, as the FBI spokesman Andy Ramirez described the scene in an interview with WNTV-4. There were shelves everywhere, filled with hundreds of glass jars. Each of them contained a penis floating in formalin. According to Agent Ramirez, the accused rapidly confessed everything as soon as he was arrested. He explained in great detail how he had been cutting off dead mens genital organs and collecting them for more than ten years. It took the FBI more than seven hours to gather all the organs and other pieces of evidence that were found on the site. A total of 53 criminal charges have already been filed against Mr. Murray and hundreds more could be filed over the next few days. An anonymous FBI source told WNTV-4 that the number of charges could reach over 3,000. Dave Murray will remain in custody for the moment as a psychiatric evaluation has been ordered to determine if hes fit to stand trial. If he is considered fit, he should appear in court in October for the beginning of the procedures.',\n 'Giant Squid Washes Ashore on Lake Michigan Michigan DNR were called to Leland to the report of a giant squid which had washed ashore. Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time theres been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern, said Dr. Polowotski. Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it, said Bob. We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow. But something like this really does make you stop and think, he said. DNR officials removed the animal from the beach and took it to an undisclosed location for further study.',\n \"Police have reportedly launched a murder investigation into Chester Benningtons death with insiders believing it is extremely likely the Linkin Park frontman was killed in eerily similar circumstances to his close friend Chris Cornell. FOUL PLAY SUSPECTED Detectives are looking into whether Chester Bennington was murdered, with the death scene later arranged to resemble a suicide. They have put a team of investigators in place and are refusing to rule out a criminal homicide charge. [UPDATE: Chester Benningtons Family & Friends Claim Media Guilty Of Murder Cover Up] Murders are sometimes made to look like suicides. We think he was murdered, we just have to find out who was behind it, said a police source. The Los Angeles County Medical Examiners office confirmed the 41-year-old nu-metal icon was found dead, but refused to provide details, with the agencys chief of operations, Brian Elias, remaining tight-lipped about whether media reports of suicide are accurate. We are investigating all angles, he said. Shocked and heartbroken, but it's true. An official statement will come out as soon as we have one.  Mike Shinoda (@mikeshinoda) July 20, 2017 SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES CONFIRMED Bennington, who sang at Chris Cornells recent funeral after becoming close to the Soundgarden frontman in recent years, was reportedly working with Cornells foundation to prevent the sexual exploitation of vulnerable children. The Linkin Park frontman, who was the father of six children, and was also the godfather to Chris Cornells son, was on record talking about the long-term emotional fallout of being sexually abused by an older male as a child. If I think back to when I was really young, to when I was being molested, to when all these horrible things were going on around me, I shudder, he told the metal magazine Kerrang! in 2011. Now investigators believe that the deaths of Cornell and Bennington  who died on Cornells birthday  may be linked. The parallels between the two deaths are astonishing. The close friends, who were working on exposing notorious entertainment industry pedophiles, died in the same way  with Benningtons death taking place on what would have been Cornells 53rd birthday. HISTORY REPEATS  SAME OLD DIRTY TRICKS Close friends of Cornell say that he was shown a black book that included the name of one of his professional associates. After setting up his foundation and investigating further, Cornell was close to exposing a network of pedophiles working within the entertainment industry  a dangerous job that he considered his duty. But his friends believe he was taken out before he finished the job. I am in tears.Chester just told me how happy he was..He was such a sweet and talented manIfeel so sad for his family,band mates and fans  Nikki Sixx (@NikkiSixx) July 20, 2017 The official investigation into Chris Cornells death is closed, but his widow and many of his fans are unsatisfied with the ruling by police and medical examiners that the Soundgarden frontman committed suicide. Detroit police wrapped up their investigations quickly and the Wayne County Medical Examiners Office ruled the death a suicide, but investigators are claiming that unexplained gaps in the official timeline of Cornells final moments and suspicious inconsistencies in the records suggest that Cornells death was not suicide at all, but a premeditated homicide and cover up. Investigator Randy Cody is among those questioning the suicide ruling. He points to perceived timeline gaps, forensic questions and what he says are two signs that Cornell had a head wound that was not mentioned in autopsy reports. Speaking to Detroit Free Press, he referenced Detroit police scanner audio in which a medic is heard saying: patient did have an exercise rubber band around his neck, suggestions of possible strangulation, trauma to the back of the head, history of depression. Patient is cool to the touch in all areas at this time. Cody also questions whether medics really broke so many of Cornells ribs in efforts to resuscitate him. You mean these medics did nine rib fractures (during CPR)? Im not buying it, said Cody, who also believes Cornell was killed because he was about to expose a child sex ring. Chester had 6 kids. If anyone out there thinks the world is better without you. You are so unspeakably wrong on every level. Get help plz  OneRepublic (@OneRepublic) July 20, 2017 UNANSWERED QUESTIONS In May, Chester Bennington tweeted, As of today, my lifes purpose is one of love and understanding. The world needs to change and that change comes from within. Hate, pride, vengeance and fear are the plague of the earth. Love, kindness, compassion, empathy and service to others are the cure. He added a challenge to his followers on Twitter, Lets all choose to be a part of the cure. If we look outside ourselves to find love and peace we will ultimately fail. It has to come from within. Lead by example. Chester Bennington was a mature, well-adjusted man who had exorcised his demons and had dedicated the rest of his life to fighting for others  including his six children and his godson, Christopher Cornell  and exposing the pedophile ring in entertainment industry. However evil forces seem determined to shut these kind of people down. As details of his death emerge, it is worth keeping an eye on who pushes hardest with the suicide angle and attempts to shut down anyone who raises questions. They may be involved in the cover-up.\",\n 'Beaumont, Texas | An employee of the Jefferson County morgue died this morning after being accidentally cremated by one of his coworkers.

Before anyone could notice the mistake, he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes. Jenna Davis, one of Henri Johnsons coworkers, says she heard him scream for about 15 seconds after the crematory was activated. At first, we didnt understand where the sound was coming from. When we realised what was happening, it was too late. We shut down the heating system, but he was already dead. Ms. Davis claims that the young coworker who caused the accident was a new employee and had forgotten to check for the toe tag to make sure he had the right body. The police have opened an investigation to determine the exact circumstances surrounding Mr. Johnsons death. Investigators have not ruled out the possibility of filing criminal charges against the employee who caused his death. The young man could possibly be accused of criminal negligence causing death.',\n 'WASHINGTON, DC (By J. McConkey)A group of leading female legislators have enacted a new bill that forbids American men from disposing of unused sperm, requiring them to bring any recreational semen to a nearby fertility clinic. According to noted alternative facts specialist, Stephanie Yorke, sperm is intended for procreation only and not to be wasted on pleasure: Any sperm not being used for the purpose of procreation must be immediately donated to a sperm bank, Yorke warned. Failure to do so will lead to hefty fines and ultimately, incarceration, under the new Level Playing Field Bill. BREAKING: Trump Reveals Plans To Build Bridge With Russia; Insists Putin Will Pay Later In response, leading male medical academics have raised concerns that refraining from masturbation would be hazardous to mens testicular health, increasing their chances of prostate cancer. Dr. David Ambrose hit out at the bill, claiming it put American men in the very difficult position of having to father and immediately surrender a child, everytime they ejaculate. He claims this will have very negative effects on mens long-term mental health. Basically, men have been put in a position of having to choose between their health and enjoyment and having to give away their child if theyre not having sex for procreation, Dr. Ambrose said. Its deeply disturbing and quite invasive to the most personal part of a mans life, he added. Not only that, but if they dont have a safe or legal way to dispose of the semen, they may resort to more harmful and unhygienic ways of getting rid of it.

His physician, Dr. Sheila Burton, has repeatedly explained to the boy that his unconceived child is more important than his own life, and he must either endure the pain or face giving away his unborn child. When asked why women in government had the right to make this decision on behalf of men or why the government should be regulating mens reproductive rights at all, the female officials replied, sorry, it came from above.

In another sweeping move aimed at undoing the perceived damage done by the Obama administration, President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday directing the Department of Justice to revoke all sixteen Thanksgiving Day turkey pardons issued by the former president during his eight years in office. After reviewing the decisions made by the previous administration, President Trump has determined that a number of turkey pardons issued by Barack Obama were done so in a manner that was both deceitful and hazardous to the American people, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced on Tuesday. This morning, the president once again used his executive powers to see to it that justice is served and that the surviving creatures will be destroyed. Spicer said very little is known about the true origins of the sixteen turkeys or why they were specifically singled out by former President Barack Obama. There are a lot of obvious questions we just dont have the answers to. Were they connected to radical Islamic terrorism? Black Lives Matter extremists? We cant be sure, he said. All we know is they were sentenced to death and Obama took it upon himself to meddle in the independent judicial process. Of the sixteen turkeys pardoned by Obama, all but five are deceased. These birds, despite their deaths, will have their pardons revoked posthumously during a ceremony in the Rose Garden, Secretary Spicer explained. The remaining birds  Tater, Tot, Abe, Honest, and Cheese  are scheduled to be remanded into federal custody on Friday before they are turned over to officials from the Federal Bureau of Prisons who are under orders to execute the turkeys by firing squad. The annual Thanksgiving Day turkey pardon dates back to 1863 when President Abraham Lincoln first granted clemency to his sons beloved pet turkey which the First Family had intended to feast on for Thanksgiving dinner.',\n 'Columbus, Ohio | An 83-year old woman was arrested this morning and accused of training dozens of cats to steal jewelry and other valuables from her neighbors. The Columbus Police Department opened an investigation on Ruth Gregson and her 65 cats in October after several neighbors reported small objects being stolen from their homes. Several victims reported being visited by Ms. Gregsons cats before noticing the disappearance of several shiny objects, like valuable cutlery and pieces of jewelry. Despite their skepticism, investigators began a surveillance operation and were amazed by what they discovered. According to Columbus Police Chief Kim Jacobs, dozens of cats were constantly coming and going, bringing home anything that shined. She was like Fagin in Oliver Twist, but she was using cats as thieves instead of children. In less than three hours of surveillance, the detectives saw the cats bring home more than a hundred objects. Upon searching Ms. Gregsons house, investigators found $650,000 worth of jewelry and precious metal among piles of worthless shiny baubles. A total of 65 adult cats and 17 kittens were found on the site and entrusted to the Columbus Humane Society. Chief Jacobs says the elderly woman confessed to training her cats to steal, saying the felines had to earn their meals. She would only feed the animals if they brought home valuables, so the animals had to steal every day in order to survive. Most were voluntarily malnurished so they would easily gain the neighbors pity and be allowed inside their houses. According to the Columbus Police, Ms. Gregsons animals could have stolen from more than 5,000 houses and apartment in the area, and investigators invite possible victims to contact them. While Ms. Gregson is the first person in American history to be accused of training cats to steal, this isnt the first time that animals are trained to commit crimes. In 2009, a surveillance that caught a monkey stealing hundreds of dollars worth of plants from a Texas nursery. At the time, the police and store owners had hypothesized that the monkey had been trained to take the plants and hand them over a fence to a waiting human accomplice. In 2013, a Chicago court sentenced a man to five years in prison for training ferrets to steal cell phones from people on the street and on public buses.',\n 'A couple was transported to the hospital in a very awkward position last night after a man somehow got his head stuck in his wifes vagina during a strange sexual game. Tom and Janis Morrison, a young couple from the small town of Greensboro in Alabama, called 911 around 10:00 pm last night to ask for an ambulance. Samantha Irving, the operator who took the call, says she thought it as a joke when he explained the situation. The woman told me that her husband had fallen and that his head was now stuck in her vaginal cavity. I really thought that it was a group of teenagers making a prank call. Despite Ms. Irvings doubts, she sent an ambulance on the site and the paramedics rapidly realized that the situation was in fact very serious. Bill Austin, one of the paramedics who transported the couple, claims they were lying naked on their bed and partially covered in blood. The woman kept screaming out in pain whenever the guy moved, but he had half of his face buried in there and he looked like he was going through Hell! The couple was transported to the nearby Hale County Hospital, where doctors were able to separate the couple. Ms. Morrison suffered from severe internal bleeding but is now stable, while her husband has suffered only a few scratches and bruises. According to doctors, both could also suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome. Incidents like this one are, indeed, quite unusual, but hundreds of couples are admitted to the hospital every year in the U.S. after getting stuck together during sexual intercourse. According to data collected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 3,213 couples were hospitalized for such problems across the country in 2015 and 3,789 in 2016. According to the same data, the Morrisons are the first couple to be hospitalized for a head stuck inside a vaginal cavity since October 2007.',\n 'Darrel Whitaker from Glenwood Springs in Colorado claims a sasquatch attacked him and attempted to rape him while he was walking in the woods. The 57-year-old man was walking to his hunting cabin on Sunday to see if it had suffered any damage during the winter. All of a sudden, a large gorilla-like creature dropped from a tree in front of him and punched him in the face. It was at least 8-foot tall and its punches hurt like hell! I was knocked right out at the first blow! While Mr. Whitaker was trying to recover from the attack, the large humanoid creature began to tear his clothes while letting out some terrifying howls. When I regained consciousness, he had already torn my pants and was tearing through my underwear. I stabbed him in the shoulder with my hunting knife, and that made him run away. Mr. Whitaker immediately reported the attack to both the Glenwood Springs Police Department (GSPD) and the Colorado Parks and Wildlife agency and a joint investigation has been launched. Darrel Whitaker is convinced that the creature who attacked him was a sasquatch, but the GSPD investigators say its more probable that the attacker is simply a particularly large and hairy man. They are currently interrogating nearby residents to see if anyone noticed an individual corresponding to the description of the suspect. According to the victim, the attacker measure around 8-foot tall and is extremely hairy. He has brown hair, dark brown eyes, and extremely large feet. If you possess any information concerning the suspect, please contact the Glenwood Springs Police Department or the Colorado Parks and Wildlife agency.',\n \"The mainstream media narrative about the Las Vegas shooting has been debunked by two explosive videos provided to Your News Wire that confirm there were multiple shooters involved in a co-ordinated attack. Both videos show gunfire originating from the fourth floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel, much lower than the 32nd floor, where the mainstream media is claiming Stephen Paddock, a lone wolf, fired on the crowd using an automatic weapon. SHOTS FIRED ON 4TH FLOOR You can clearly see shots being fired from the fourth floor of the Mandalay Bay. #LasVegasShooting Posted by The People's Voice on Monday, October 2, 2017 The mainstream media narrative regarding Paddocks motives have also been debunked by FBI sources who reportedly claimed the shooter has links to Antifa as well as ISIS. But mainstream media is actively covering up the information, claiming Paddock had no political or religious affiliations or interests. The fact is the Las Vegas shooting was clearly an co-ordinated false flag attack, orchestrated by Paddock as well as at least one other as yet unidentified gunman operating from the fourth floor of the hotel. The mass shooting and scores of dead will be used by the elite to further their nefarious agenda. [RELATED  Bellagio Hotel Guests And Staff Confirm Multiple Shooters] Anybody who looks into the information available to them on the internet will arrive at the same conclusion.

SECOND LAS VEGAS SHOOTER More evidence of a second shooter at the 4th floor window of the Mandalay Bay hotel. #LasVegasShooting Posted by The People's Voice on Monday, October 2, 2017 The questions must be asked: why is the mainstream media covering for a mass murderer? Why are they attempting to rewrite his past and erase his political affiliations? The answers are simple. The corporate media, controlled by a small, elite oligarchy, is operating on behalf of the New World Order, attempting to mislead the public into believing their enemies are their friends, and their friends are their enemies. [RELATED  Hotel Guest Next Door To Shooter Saw Multiple Gunmen] It doesnt suit the mainstream medias agenda to have an Antifa member responsible for the worst mass shooting in American history. They are actively engaged in covering up this fact up so they can continue pushing the New World Orders sick and twisted agenda. Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter, was an Antifa member who carried out the worst mass shooting in American history in order to create further division in American society, push the country towards civil war, and further the agenda of the elites. Official Antifa facebook page, Antifa Melbourne, congratulated Stephen Paddock after the bloodiest mass shooting in Americas history, before deleting the post after a torrent of criticism. There is an active campaign to sow division and create chaos in the United States. Organized groups are working on behalf of global organizations with the most nefarious of goals. We need to wake up and stop believing everything fed to us by the mainstream media. They have proven themselves completely unreliable. We need to stop hiding from the truth.\",\n 'Greensburg clown found eating a live cat.

Mr. Howard claims he was involved in the controlled demolition of World Trade Center 7, the third building that was destroyed on 9/11. Mr. Howard, who worked for the CIA for 36 years as an operative, claims he was tapped by senior CIA agents to work on the project due to his engineering background, and an early career in the demolition business. Trained as a civil engineer, Mr. Howard became an explosives expert after being headhunted by the CIA in early 1980s. Mr. Howard says he had extensive experience in planting explosives in items as small as cigarette lighters and as large as 80 floor buildings. The 79-year-old New Jersey native says he worked on the CIA operation they dubbed New Century between May 1997 and September 2001, during a time he says the CIA was still taking orders from the top. Mr. Howard says he was part of a cell of 4 operatives tasked with ensuring the demolition was successful. Mr. Howard says the World Trade Center 7 operation is unique among his demolitions, as it is the only demolition that we had to pretend wasnt a demolition job. He claims he had no problem going through with the deception at the time, because when you are a patriot, you dont question the motivation of the CIA or the White House. You assume the bigger purpose is for a greater good. They pick good, loyal people like me, and it breaks my heart to hear the shit talk. [John Kerry Admits WTC 7 Was Brought Down By Controlled Demolition] But even he admits that now, looking back, Something wasnt right. No good has come from this. This isnt the America we envisioned. Explaining how the building was bought down, Mr. Howard says, It was a classic controlled demolition with explosives. We used super-fine military grade nanothermite composite materials as explosives. The hard part was getting thousands of pounds of explosives, fuses and ignition mechanisms into the building without causing too much concern. But almost every single office in the Building 7 was rented by the CIA, the Secret Service, or the military, which made it easier. Mr. Howard explains that WTC 7 was loaded with explosives in strategic places in the month leading up to the day that changed the course of American history. On September 11th, while the North and South towers burned, fuses were ignited in World Trade Center 7, and nanothermite explosions hollowed out the building, destroying the steel structure, removing the reinforcements, and allowing the office fires to tear through the rest of the building, hollowing it out like a shell. World Trade Center 7 collapsed into its own footprint at 5:20pm, seven hours after the destruction of WTC 1 and 2. The building shocked witnesses by coming down at the speed of freefall, indicating that it encountered zero resistance on the way down. Mr. Howard and his colleagues had done their job. When the building came down, it was such a rush. Everything went exactly to plan. It was so smooth. Everybody was evacuated. Nobody was hurt in WTC 7. We were celebrating. We kept watching replays of the demolition, we had the whiskey and cigars out, and then all of a sudden the strangest thing happened. We all started to worry that it looked a bit too smooth. We watched the tape again and again and again and we started to get paranoid. It looked like a controlled demolition. We thought shit, people are going to question this. And then we heard that people from the street were reporting that they heard the explosions during the afternoon. When we were told that the BBC botched their report and announced to the world that the building collapsed 20 minutes before it actually did At that point we really thought the gig was up. According to the official 9/11 report issued by the government, WTC 7 collapsed due to uncontrolled fires that were caused by debris that floated over from WTC 1 and 2, which had been hit by passenger planes. If the official narrative was true, WTC 7 would be the first tall building in the world to ever collapse due to uncontrolled fires, and the only steel skyscraper in the world to have collapsed into itself, due to office fires. Mr. Howard and his colleagues feared the public would see through the official narrative and rise up against the government, demanding to be told the truth. There were so many loose ends, so much evidence left behind. We thought the public would be all over it. We thought there would be a public uprising that the media couldnt ignore. Theyd be funding investigations and demanding to know why they were being lied to. We thought theyd find chemical composites in the area that would prove Building 7 was blown up. We thought there would be a revolution. It would go all the way to the top, to President Bush. Hed be dragged out of the White House. But none of that happened. Almost nobody questioned anything. The media shot down anyone who dared question anything they were told. Follow the money Mr. Howard claims he has no direct knowledge about the destruction of North and South Towers of the World Trade Center, explaining that CIA operations are very specific and that it is common to be working on a larger project while only understanding a small piece of the puzzle. [9/11: Larry Silverstein Designed New WTC-7 One Year Before Attacks] But he has advice for investigators seeking to understand the entire puzzle and work out who was behind the most devastating attack on American soil in history. Follow the money. When you want to find out who is behind something, just follow the money. Look at the trades made just before 9/11. These are the guys that knew what was coming. The sons of CIA agents, government officials. Close relatives of the most powerful men in America. Cheney, Rumsfeld. They all got rich. It wasnt just the contracts awarded to their friends in the construction business and the wars and the kickbacks. It was insider trading. Many countries including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Monaco launched insider trading investigations in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, believing that if they could prove Al-Qaeda operatives profited on the stock market then they could prove the terror organization was behind the attacks. And all the evidence pointed to heavy insider trading around 9/11. Italys foreign minister, Antonio Martino, said: I think that there are terrorist states and organizations behind speculation on the international markets. German central bank president, Ernst Welteke, said his researchers had found almost irrefutable proof of insider trading. Even CNN reported that regulators were seeing ever-clearer signs that someone manipulated financial markets ahead of the terror attack in the hope of profiting from it. Mr. Howard says that a serious study of who profited on the stock market from 9/11 would tear the heart out of the oligarchy in America. There is only one organization that spans the entire world, and let me tell you now, it isnt and it never was al-Qaeda. Its the CIA. There could never be a real investigation. The entire shadow government, as you call them now, are implicated. The 79-year-old, spending his final weeks at home, said he doesnt expect to be taken into custody following his confession because then theyd have to go after everyone else. They will just use the media to attack me. They are all on the payroll to suppress everything around 9/11.',\n 'A group of liberal Hollywood celebrities are threatening a massive, all-round Hollywood strike unless Donald Trump resigns. Describing Hollywood as the base of the entire modern American culture, the group also claims to be speaking on behalf of all of humanity. Its about time people understood that were the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us, not the other way around, a spokesperson for the group told The New York Times. Were calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood, starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props, movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops. Spinzon reports: Rosie ODonnell, Debra Messing, Ed Asner and Michael Shannon are among the dozens of artists, entertainers, and activists who have attached their names to an effort calling for a month-long protest to stop President-elect Donald Trump. No! In the Name of Humanity We Refuse to Accept a Fascist America! reads a full-page ad placed in the New York Times on Wednesday by the group Refuse Racism. Donald Trump, the President-elect, is assembling a regime of grave danger, the ad says. Millions of people in the US and around the world are filled with deep anxiety, fear and disgust. Our anguish is right and just. Our anger must now become massive resistance  before Donald Trump is inaugurated and has the full reins of power in his hands. Other Hollywood celebrities who have also joined the campaign, however, are calling for an all-out strike that would span the entire movie industry in the hopes that such a move would urge the President-elect to resign from his position as the newly elected President of the United States. Were calling for a general strike that would include every single person involved in making motion pictures in Hollywood, starting with the actors and celebrities themselves and encompassing companies in charge of making props, movie memorabilia and even souvenir shops, a spokesperson for the Refuse Racism group told The New York Times. Its about time people understood that were the ones with the power and that the president is there to serve us, not the other way around. Asked to elaborate on why the group is targeting Hollywood out of all the industries in the country as their bargaining chip, the spokesperson argued that Hollywood is, simply put, the base of the entire modern American culture. It is the foundation of the country, so to speak, the glue thats holding it together. And think about what happens when you destroy the foundation of a house. It comes crashing down, right? Well, thats exactly whats going to happen to America unless Donald Trump realizes how real the danger of that actually is, and chooses to step down as President of his own free will. And while were on the subject, between you and me  nobody wants Hollywood to stop doing its thing, but this is a necessary move. Besides, its not like the billionaire-businessman-turned-president hasnt ventured into movies in his day, right? So, hell understand firsthand whats going to happen if Hollywood goes to strike. Without the work of Hollywood and the lifestyle promoted by it, there will literally be no more America to rule for Trump. So, in effect, its not us that are going to force Donald Trump to resign his office; its the people of America who are going to make him do it, because the Gods honest truth is  without Hollywood, there is no America. Its like trying to run Nazi Germany without Hitler at the forefront  it just becomes pointless, the spokesperson concluded.',\n 'A study published by NPR reveals that over 25 million Hillary Clinton votes were completely fraudulent, meaning that the Democratic candidate actually lost the popular vote by a huge margin. A study by the Pew Center claiming that over 800,000 non-citizens voted for Hillary Clinton failed to take into account dead and fraudulent voters which totalled over 25 million registered voters. According to reports, illegal aliens combined with dead voters and multiple state voters explains why Hillary appeared to have won the popular vote over Trump during this years presidential race. Infowars.com reports: A report by the Pew Center on the States finds that more than 1.8 million dead people are currently registered to vote, and 24 million registrations are either invalid or inaccurate, NPR reported in 2012, which is ironic given how NPR is heavily controlled by Democrats. And many of the dead, registered voters somehow keep voting Democrat from beyond the grave, most recently in Philadelphia, Penn. and Colorado. Its also worth noting that the U.S. population has increased since 2012, meaning that theres likely more dead and invalid voters than before. The Pew study found that almost 3 million people are registered to vote in more than one state, NPR added. Thats because when a new resident registers to vote in a state, officials usually never bother to tell his former state about the change in voter residency. Under the catch and release immigration program by the Obama administration, illegal aliens were routinely given bus tickets to travel to other states by immigration officials, so it was theoretically possible for non-citizens to register to vote in a border country illegally, then register to vote in another state after their taxpayer-funded bus dropped them off. Clinton won most of the 163 most populous counties in the US that account for half of the total votes in the election, including dense urban areas in New York and California, yet she only won the popular vote by 2.8 million votes, which reveals the lack of enthusiasm voters had for her in comparison to Trump  and that Democrats would have depended more on illegal votes. A portion of the 24 million invalid voter registrations combined with a portion of the 1.8 million dead voters and the over 800,000 known illegal voters could explain the difference of 2.8 million votes, and its worth noting that the 800,000 figure could be a low, conservative estimate. That said, a popular vote victory is meaningless; if the president was elected by popular vote, then both Trump and Clinton would have campaigned in entirely different states because only densely population regions of the U.S. would decide who would become president. Without the electoral college, the United States of America would be reduced to the United States of New York and California, with 48 other vassal states. Yet notice how Clinton campaigned in other, less populated states. They knew the popular vote was meaningless ahead of the election. However, the popular vote is useful as a barometer for voter fraud since the most populous countries are also the most susceptible to election tampering by illegal, invalid and dead voters.',\n 'Greensburg clown found eating a live cat.

Bieber has become a regular at the Bible study class held at the Montage in Beverly Hills and on Saturday 22nd July he shared what he described as a horrific story with the congregation and explained why he felt he had to quit his world tour. Describing a party on tour  attended by the upper echelon of the music business, including executive VPs of development, producers, power agents and international financiers  Bieber said he was encouraged to sexually abuse a young child who had been bought to the party for the sexual gratification of the industry elite. I didnt want to do this. I really didnt. They said this kid was drugged, it was horrible, Bieber said, explaining that it was made clear to him that he would gain entry to the business side of the industry if he joined the club by passing the initiation rites. I wouldnt just be a performer, Id be a mogul. That path would open up for me, like it did for Jay-Z. Its the difference between being a millionaire and being a billionaire. But Bieber told the congregation that he couldnt do it. To join the club Id have to do bad things to this poor kid. But then I realized that even that wasnt enough for them. Id also have to kill this little child. Bieber said he had heard rumors about this type of initiation in the music industry, but he had not been confronted with it before. I got told they secretly film these parties. Once theyve got you on video doing something like that, they own you. Bieber said his conscience is clear because he didnt participate, but the fate of the drugged child is haunting him. They said this kid was raped by a few different guys. They said he was bleeding. I got out of there but I heard he died and that haunts me.

But more and more stars are coming forward with similar stories about the depraved Hollywood and music industry system. In recent months Nicole Kidman and Lindsay Lohan also spoke out about pedophilia in Hollywood. Close friends of Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington claim the recently deceased pair were working on exposing the pedophile ring working at the heart of the music industry  and it cost them their lives.

In an email from John Podesta to Huma Abedin, the pair discuss diverting Clinton campaign funds to various Republicans who were secretly on the Clinton payroll.

For instance FEC reports shows that two large donations from PACS and private sources ln early October went to John McCain right after he attacked Trump publicly criticized Trump. That happened shortly after a slew of emails concerning moving money to support one candidate and move support from another. Shortly thereafter, his challenger in this tight race, Kirkpatrick, lost several key donors and money and support lessened from the DNC and the DSCC in the last few weeks of the race. The thing to note is that McCain is one of the lead sponsors of a committee to investigate any Russian influence into the election. Senator Lindsay Graham, another outspoken critic of Donald Trump and briefly candidate for President from July to December also it seems received help from the Clintons. An email that simply states, Cleared the road for him in 2020, could mean that there will be no strong or supported Democrat in the South Carolina Senate race when Graham is up for re-election. As with McCain, Graham has publicly called for a look into the Russian influence in the election. There were a lot of politicians who were opposed to Donald Trump. These, in particular, all share a common bond, however: Trump humiliated them on stage in front of hundreds of millions of people around the world. This is more than just politics or conscientious objecting, this was revenge. Not just revenge. This is out and out treason. Our representatives took an oath to support our Constitution and its laws for our benefit, not theirs. This is why gridlock is prevalent in D.C.the treachery and the corruption are on both sides of the coin. Unfortunately, there is no way of knowing who the true Republicans are and who are the ones that are fronts for the Clinton machine, the Pantsuit Mafia. The number of emails is too overwhelming to easily sift through them all to find all of the turncoat RINOs. We must be diligent to ferret out those that have sold their souls for power. The only hope that we have for transparency of the Clintons anytime soon rests in an audit carried out by the IRS. Behold, in recent days, there is a call to impeach the Commissioner of the IRS. Interesting times we live in to be sure. Only time and work on our part will push this audit forward. Even though Hillary lost the Presidency, she is still a power behind the scenes with these revelations. With her Democratic allies in Pelosi and Schumer and her Republican lackeys in the form of Ryan and other Republicans, she will set the agenda and pull the strings. We the people will have no idea who is on our side and who is not. For the Clintons, it will mean that even though the American people are supporting Trump and making America great again, they will set the agenda. We will be left scratching our heads and wondering how the GOP and Trump cannot accomplish anything. Clinton will be in control without having to ever show her hand or be responsible to the people. The Soros-Clinton team will have killed the Republic and we will never know until it is too late. This Russian news story perhaps is the ultimate coup for the Clinton Camp. She does not even have to be the winner of the Electoral College vote to have gained power. Should enough electors defect to Hillary or name another candidate in their votes (Electors are NOT legally bound to vote for their candidate), then that could throw the vote into the House and Senate. The suspicious part of this simply is this, On January 20th a new president will be inaugurated. The Constitution in the 25th Amendment spells out the line of succession if there is still not a picked President, the Vice President shall become president (Kaine or Pence). If the Senate has not picked a Vice-President by noon on the 20th, the Speaker of the House shall become President. Coincidence? The Roman Republic lasted for centuries in the hands of the people before falling to become the Roman Empire. That change did not happen by a foreign invasion or foreign intrigue. No barbarian or forceful enemy defeated that Republic over 2000 years ago. It was defeated from the inside by the treachery of the Senate and the blood of the slain Julius Caesar. Just as Caesar was stabbed in the back by men he thought were his allies, Trump is facing the same treachery. In the coming days and months, without our help and diligence, President Trump may also be gasping..Et Tu, Paul?',\n 'Woman Slays Gator with Butter Knife The Ohio river is known for it\\'s vast selection of weird fish and creatures in the water. People have seen everything from small fresh water sharks to Alligator Gar. Well now you can add Alligators to that list. On July 23rd 2017 Ben Shoemaker and his family were swimming in the Ohio river when they noticed something in the water. Ben told us \"it was a hot humid day so we decided to take a dip\". He said \"at first I thought it was a log. That sucker must have been at least 9ft long, he was huge\". Ellen Shoemaker, (wife of Ben Shoemaker) said. The next day; however, local woman, Lauri Dukes, was picnicking in River park when she spotted the behemoth Gator sunning on the park\\'s shore. The only weapon, Ms. Duke, had was a butter knife, which she was using to spread mayonnaise on a sandwich. Realizing the Gator was a threat to the community, she stealthily creeped up on the Gator and killed it with a swift stab through the eye with her butter knife. Ms. Duke, added all her family would be receiving Gator skin boots for Christmas this year.',\n ...]"
