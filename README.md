Abstract 
The proliferation of misleading information in everyday access media outlets such as social media feeds, news blogs, and online newspapers have made it challenging to identify trustworthynews sources, thus increasing the need for computational tools able to provide insights into thereliability of online content.  In this paper, we focus on the automatic identification of fake con-tent in online news.  Our contribution is twofold.  First, we introduce two novel datasets for thetask of fake news detection, covering seven different news domains. We describe the collection,annotation, and validation process in detail and present several exploratory analyses on the iden-tification of linguistic differences in fake and legitimate news content.  Second, we conduct aset of learning experiments to build accurate fake news detectors, and show that we can achieveaccuracies of up to 76%.   In addition,  we provide comparative analyses of the automatic andmanual identification of fake news.
